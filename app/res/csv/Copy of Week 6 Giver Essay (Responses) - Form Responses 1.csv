10/1/2014 16:32:57,"Kivisto, Maya",Compare and contrast,"The Giver and Jonas are very diffrent. The giver is smarter, Jonas is younger, and Jonas is less important. The Giver is smarter because he has more experience. He is wise and has special injections. The Giver also has more pain and learns from his mistakes.
   Jonas is younger by age and by looks. Jonas is very stubborn and curious. He has alot to learn about the world. He has alot to be taught he is not very educated.
  Jonas is also not important in the community. Jonas is just a kid that is in the community like all the others. But he is a big part in the story . The Giver is very important though. He hold all the secrets of there community . And without him they are nothing.", H
10/1/2014 17:43:18,"Vinogradov, Aaron",The Giver ompare/contrast,"Jonas being as the new receiver of memory has been a bit more scared at the beginning of the selection for being ""the receiver of memory."" Jonas likes receiving old memories of the past. The reason why is because he like the feeling the memories of the past and snow,etc. Also the old Giver usually hated a lot of the memories but as he got older and wiser he realized they where not so bad after all and a one in a life dream or memory for the community. A huge impact on Jonas is rule number 8 you may lie to others,which makes him question if all the adults have been lying since they get the newborn children.

Jonas,he starts not sleeping enough because of his dreams and memories he gets of the past,war. Some same things about them would be they both like each other and enjoy talking to one another. Jonas starts complaining about his clothes that are all lifeless and boring because of how the community decides the clothes should be and also how their lives have colors in their memories, except the Giver.

Finally the differences of the giver and Jonas. Jonas, he has these weird ideas that nobody had well the past of the community givers. Jonas is a fresh person, and the giver is old and been dealing with lots of pain and physical pain too. Jonas is very brave and takes the risk of receiving memories of people dying and where he is also dying.","The Giver, Chapters 9+ in the Giver"

10/1/2014 22:26:20,"Waters, Hannah",Jonas and the current Reciever,"Jonas and the old receiver are very different and similar.  When the old receiver was twelve years old, like Jonas, he was scared too.  Jonas and the old receiver are also both wise, brave, independent, caring for other people, and have a lot of courage.  Right now they both probably have the most important job they have ever had in their entire lives.  The receivers are very important people in the community and I cannot wait to read more.  

Jonas is a very young man who has just started learning about his new job.  He is not sure what to think of the rules of receiver. Or the things he cannot do any more like, having extracurricular activities and he does not know what will happen to his friends.  The current receiver (Jonas) does not think he can live up to this role and he does not know if he can do it.  Along the way,  he has friends to help him out.  He will probably end up being a great receiver with a great life.  Jonas is a great student, person, and will be a great receiver.

The old man is also the receiver or The Giver.  He is a mysterious, wise man who knows all the pasts, present, and future secrets.  To Jonas, he is his trainer, his friend, maybe even a relative. He will spend much of his time with him and learn all of his past adventures.  His memories will be passed on and another generation of receivers will live on after his trains Jonas and when Jonas trains somebody else. It will probably go on for a long time.  That’s my description

10/2/2014 18:24:45,"Fajardo, Amazigh",Comparing and Constracting,"The Giver and Jonas have many differences, but they also have many things that are the same. Things that are the the same are the pale eyes, they both are Receivers, and they not only have courage but also the capacity to see beyond. They also have differences such as when Jonas doesn't know what a sled is, that means the Giver is more intelligent than him. Other ones can be that the Giver is an elder; he has a beard and grey hair, he has been a Receiver for a very long time, so he has many memories, memories of the past. The Giver will tell things that Jonas doesn't know about, things that nobody knows about. Now let's  move to differences Jonas has. Jonas is a boy of twelve, he has a little sister called Lily, he lives with his parents at a normal house and has a friend called Asher. He was apprehensive about the ceremony and he is not sure about breaking rules for his job. He doesn't know if he can resist the painful memories of life given by the Giver. Other things that are different that the Giver has is that he looks old because of the memories he keeps within him. That's all for this essay, bye!",
10/2/2014 18:30:30,"Dutra, Daniel",Jonas to the Giver,"     In the book, The Giver , Jonas is the main character. Then, later in the book, 
he meets the Giver. When Jonas first notices the Giver in the crowd (page 61) he sees that they both have the same pale eyes. Well, that is just only one of their similarities. As in page 62, you read how both the Giver and Jonas have the qualities of intellegence, integrity, and courage. All of those are qualities of a good Receiver-of-Memory. You also read that the two of them are the Receivers with the Capacity to See Beyond.
     There may be a lot of similarities, but there as many of those as there are differences. Probably the most major difference between the two of them is the fact that Jonas is a boy and The Giver is a grown man. Jonas has only started his job. Some other things that only Jonas has that is different than is: Jonas still has a family unit, he has much time before he retires, and Jonas also is only beginning to understand his new job.
     Some qualities of the Giver that are different than Jonas is: the Giver is much older than Jonas, but the Giver is younger than he looks(page 76). The Giver also has all the memories of the world, which Jonas will learn soon (page 77) .Lastly, it seems as if the Giver has no family unit at the time. Even though the Giver and Jonas are similar in many things, their differences are many also.",
10/3/2014 20:28:29,"Cabrera, Mia",The Giver : Compare and Contrast,"     In the Giver, Jonas , the Reciver  in training, and The Giver, the current Reciver,are different because Jonas does not know as much as the Giver. Another reason is because Jonas thinks he knows pain but he really does not. Some reasons are because one, The Giver thinks Jonas learned faster than himself. And two, because Jonas does not have wisdom yet.

     In the Giver, Jonas and he are the same because one, they agree on everything. Two, because they think color should be restored. Three, they want people to be able to choose some things. And forth, because every body should be able to have books.

    In conclusion, The Giver and Jonas have diffrences and similarities. Some of them are good and some of them are bad. 
                                            THE END",
10/4/2014 16:14:47,"Everette, Gianna",Differences,"     There are many differences between Jonas and The Giver. Jonas is quite new to receiving memories from The Giver while The Giver is loaded with them. Also, The Giver is quite old, but Jonas is still young. However, there is two things that are common between them. The first one is that they both have pale eyes. Second is that they are both Receiver of memories.

     The Giver has many character traits and knows quite a bit of things. The Giver is quite old and contains memories of the past about the whole entire world. He also will give Jonas his memories so they can be received from each receiver for a very long time. Also, he will teach Jonas the Capacity to See Beyond and will help him throughout his training. Even though The Giver has very little experience teaching Jonas about the memories, he still helps Jonas achieve his wisdom through the memories.

     Jonas is the new Receiver of Memory. He will receive memories of the past, about the whole entire world, from The Giver. Although he is quite new to the subject, he adapts and learns quite quickly to the Giver's instructions. He is only a Twelve, is an adult-in-training, and will learn about the past. Jonas will soon see colors more frequently and will obtain the required wisdom for a Receiver of Memory.

10/5/2014 10:46:16,"Chen, Michael",Comparing and Contrasting Jonas with the Current Giver,"     One main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is that Jonas comes to quick conclusions, but the current Giver does not. For example, on page 95, when the Giver says, ”We gained control of many things. But we had to let go of others,” Jonas says,”We shouldn’t have!” This shows that Jonas has strong emotions, is not afraid to show what he wants, and comes to quick conclusions. After that, the Giver says (pg. 95),” You’ve come quickly to that conclusion. It took me many years. Maybe your wisdom will come much more quickly than mine.” This also shows that Jonas has quick and accurate conclusions and learns quickly, but it also shows that the Giver did not have those skills when he was young. That is why one main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is that Jonas comes to quick conclusions, but the Giver does not.
     Another main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is how enthusiastic they are about the training. For example, on page 85, Jonas insists on feeling some pain, but the Giver says that it is not necessary yet. This means that Jonas is very excited and optimistic about the training, but the Giver is very careful because of the earlier failure. Also, on page 107, on a day after one that he had been sent away on, he asks the Giver what causes him pain. He tells him to give him some of it so he does not feel as much. That is why the extent of enthusiasm about training is a main difference between Jonas and the current Giver.
     A third main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is how they respond to events in their life. For example, as stated earlier, on page 95, when the Giver says,” We gained control of many things. But we had to let go of others,” Jonas says, “We shouldn’t have!” The Giver is calm and placid, but Jonas is excited and provoked. It is the same thing with the training. Jonas is excited and optimistic about the training, but the Giver is cautious and discreet about it because of the earlier failure. On page 97, it says, “The Giver told him it would be a very long time before he had the colors to keep. ‘But I want them!’ Jonas said angrily. ‘It isn’t fair that nothing has color!’ ‘Not fair?’ The Giver looked at Jonas curiously. ’Explain what you mean.’ “Jonas is angry and proud while he talks, but the Giver is calm and tranquil. That is why I think a main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is how they respond to events in their life.

10/5/2014 17:36:47,"Minear, Matthew",Giver,"Jonas has been give an assignment for life since he graduated the ceremony of twelve's. This new job assignment is to be the receiver of memory until he reaches the house of old. As a receiver of memory he will  be trained  by the Giver to receive all of the memories of the world that go far back in time.

Jonas is different from the Giver. One difference is that Jonas is new to being the receiver of memory while the giver has mastered this skill for many years of practice. When Jonas receives his first memory from the Giver about snow and sledding. He is upset that snow was taken away when they went to sameness. Jonas question the Giver can cant understand why they cant even have these things now and then. Jonas doesn't want to accept this but the Giver has simply understood this and accepted it was unsafe.

Finally the Giver helps Jonas figure out that he is now seeing the color red which is the real color of Fiona's hair. Jonas here again is upset because they did it away with color too. Jonas says ""we shouldn't have."" The Giver tells Jonas that there are a lot of more years of wisdom. He said that he had many years of quick wisdom and many with long wisdom as sooner than the Giver.","Jonas is confused in chapter eleven  page 83- But what happened to those things? Snow and the rest of it? as Jonas questions the Giver. 

In chapter 12 page 95- Jonas explains to the Giver that he is late training because he saw something different."
10/5/2014 18:22:37,"Dal Ponte, Hannah",Jonas to the Giver,"         There are many similarities and differences between Jonas and the Giver.  They both were chosen to be the Giver (pg. 60).  But now it is Jonas's turn to hold all the memories, good and bad.  Holding the memories for so long, the Giver has become old and tired.   In comparison, Jonas is energetic and curious.  Jonas wants to talk about his job with his friends and family, but he knows he and the Giver cannot (pg. 99).  Being the Giver is a lot of responsibility as you can see.
	Jonas and the Giver have very different lives.  The old Receiver of Memory has no family.  His room is his life, where he keeps his books and where he stays every day.  He did have a wife, but she now lives with the Childless Adults (pg. 102).  Jonas on the other hand has a family unit and lots of friends.  The Giver can also see in full color, unlike Jonas who is just starting to see the color red (pg. 94).  It began with the apple, then the people's faces at the ceremony of 12, and lastly with Fiona's hair. 
	The Giver holds within him all the memories of the past.  Holding the pain of bad memories from the past allows the people of the community to not suffer.   Jonas thought that after receiving the memory of snow that everything was going to be fun to receive (pg. 81).  But then the Giver showed him a elephant dying and what a gun is (pg. 100).  Now Jonas knows how brave the old Giver must be to hold all the bad memories.
",the book The Giver
10/5/2014 20:17:52,"Yang, Yi Jen",Jonas v.s The Giver ,"    There are many differences between Jonas and the current Giver. The first thing is that, the current Giver is more experienced than Jonas. First, The Giver has received more memories than him; also The Giver was in this position and job much longer than Jonas. In chapter 10, the Giver even says, “I have been the Receiver for a long time. A very, very long time.”  The Giver knows many more memories, than Jonas. So far Jonas has had only like 3 memories sunburn, snow, and sunshine. Obviously, if the Giver wasn’t more experienced than Jonas, how could he transmit memory, for example snow, to Jonas when Jonas doesn’t even know what that is? 
    Another difference about the current Receiver and the current Giver is their age difference. Jonas is a twelve, and the Giver is pretty old. In chapter 10, Jonas said, “I can see that you are very old.” Also, using context clues, most likely on the front cover of the book there is an old man which most likely is the current Giver. Another thing is that the Giver said that long time ago when he was once twelve he felt the same way Jonas did when he came to this training. 
    Lastly, Jonas is definitely immature than the current Giver who is mature. Jonas was a little frustrated when he learned about the colors and how he wishes he could choose what tunic to wear red or yellow. On the other hand the Giver is patiently and curiously looking at Jonas. The Giver is very mature because, he doesn’t just start shouting out his opinions, or ideas. Probably that’s just because he is older than Jonas. Those are the differences between Jonas and the current Receiver.

10/6/2014 19:16:13,"Safdar, Humza",The Difference Between Jonas and the Giver,"      The similarities between Jonas and the Giver are that they both have light eyes,they both are the receivers of memories,and they both can see positive things about the world.Jonas is an eleven year old boy who is sensitive and intelligent.Jonas is usually thoughtful and expresses great concern about the people who care about him.Jonas can see things that people can't see, so basically his universe widens.That is Jonas' world.

10/6/2014 19:16:27,"Dennis Talley, Nicole",Comparing and Contrasting Jonas and the Giver,"     There are differences and similarities between the Giver and Jonas. A difference between them is the Giver is old and Jonas is young. The Giver said the job aged him and will age Jonas (pages 75-76). Another difference is Jonas has not been in physical pain yet. The Giver has and sometimes is too upset to transmit memories from the past with Jonas. Whereas Jonas has not been upset yet but excited and fascinated with the memories ( pages 106). 
     Jonas is fascinated about the memories because he had experienced   exciting and fun memories. For example the first memory he had was when he was at the top of the hill when it was snowing. Then he slid down with his face cutting through the cold air. It was so new to him and he liked it (pages 80-82). Another example is when he was outdoors in the sunshine.  He loved the warmth and loved the sky ( pages 84-85).
      A similarity between The Giver and Jonas is they are the only ones who can ""see beyond."" They can see different colors that everyone else can not see. The Giver and Jonas also are the only ones who are allowed to read the books in the Giver's office. But, the sad part is they can not share the books with their family or friends ( page 102). One more similarity between them is they are the only ones who can see the past. For example Jonas saw an elephant for the first time and heard a sound he never heard before by an elephant. The Giver transmitted the memory so he knew about it and probably has more of those memories (pages 100, 77).",
10/6/2014 19:18:46,"Chan, Christian",The receivers,"Jonas and the Giver were both the receivers (page 76).  They both had to go through training first (page 86).  They were both skipped (page 73).  They both went to the ceremony of the 12ths (page 63).  They are both intelligent (page 78). 

Jonas is the new receiver (page 76).  Jonas is young (page 63).  Jonas is twelve (page 63).  Jonas did not want to lie. (page 90).  Jonas did not think he had the power to see beyond (page 78).","The giver was the previous receiver (page 76).  The giver is old (page 96).  The giver is not actually old (page 96).  The givers energy is starting to diminish (page 96).  The giver said, ""their is no time for apologies"" (page 95)."
10/6/2014 20:08:09,"Salvacion, Mykaela Antonette",Compare and Contrast: the Giver and Jonas,"    The Giver and Jonas are similar in many ways. One similarity that they both share is their pale eyes (pgs. 20 & 61). Everyone else in the community has dark eyes, with the exception of a few (pg. 20). This is a symbol that they both have the ability to “see-beyond” (pg. 63). Another similarity the Giver and Jonas share is the honor and separation from the community. When Jonas is selected to become the Receiver of Memory, he immediately senses that he is different from the rest of the community, and this puts him at unease (pg. 65). Since the Giver is also the Receiver of Memory, he also is different and separate from the community, though he is more used to this. These were some similarities between Jonas and the Giver.
	Jonas and the Giver are also different in a number of ways. One difference they both have is their reaction to being separate from the community. The Giver is used to this, since he had much more training than Jonas, and does not seem bothered by it (pgs. 103 & 104). On the other hand, Jonas is nervous, because throughout his whole life he has learned that differences were considered to be wrong (pgs. 38 & 65). A second difference between the Giver and Jonas is that they both experienced the “Capacity to See Beyond” but in different ways (pg. 92). When Jonas got his first signs of the Capacity to See Beyond, what he saw was the color red (pg. 94). The Giver, however, explains that his seeing-beyond happened to him in a different way, which he will tell Jonas what it exactly is later (pg. 96). These were some differences between Jonas and the Giver.
	Though the Giver and Jonas are different in many ways, they are also similar in many ways as well. Jonas and the Giver share physical similarities, and emotional similarities as well. Both have pale eyes, which means they can both see beyond (pg. 20 & 61). The Giver and Jonas are physically separate from the community because they train alone with only each other, and they are not allowed to share it with anybody (pgs. 61 & 68). They are emotionally separate from the community because, since they are not allowed to share their training with anybody, only they know the true pleasures and pains of life and that the world was different “back and back and back” (pgs. 94 – 107). Of course, the Giver and Jonas are different in many ways as well. For example, they “see-beyond” for the first time differently (pg. 92). “Seeing-beyond” for Jonas first happens when he sees a flash of red in an apple, which slowly begins to occur in other objects, such as the audience at the annual Ceremony and Fiona’s hair (pg. 94). However, later in the book, the Giver explains to Jonas that he “hears-beyond” for the first time, and when Jonas asks him what he hears, he says he hears music (pg. 157). In conclusion, the Giver and Jonas share many similarities and differences.

10/6/2014 20:15:43,"Morrison, Audrey",Jonas Compared to The Giver,"Jonas is in training to become the new receiver of memory and the current receiver of memory is already doing the job. The giver already knows all the memories where as Jonas does not, so the giver has to give him the memories. Jonas is beginning to see color and the giver already sees all the colors.

	The giver started hearing music before he started seeing colors, but Jonas started seeing the color red before he heard music. When Jonas explained about him seeing the color red, the giver said he felt the same way. Jonas is very curious and the giver was not very curious. The giver is a lot older than Jonas and wiser. Jonas is still kind of working on the rules of his new selection where as the giver knows the rules well. The giver is more serious than Jonas. Jonas feels kind of weird in a way like everything is different and the giver is used to the situation.

	Jonas is feeling trapped like he can’t describe his training and the giver is keeping everything good and not worrying about not telling people. The giver is very calm, but Jonas is still young and has energy. The current receiver of memory has to transport the memories to Jonas because Jonas doesn’t know the memories and he has to have them to be the receiver of memory. Jonas is learning still and has a long way to go where as the giver has already learned all the memories.

10/6/2014 20:38:58,"Vagnerova, Elizabeth",Compare and Contrast ; the Giver and Jonas,"The similarities of the Giver and Jonas, are that both of them could not share their training of being a Receiver , which is in Chapter 13 , page 102.Page 70 says both Jonas and Giver have pale eyes ,meaning only that they cannot see color , not that their totally blind. Both Giver and Jonas have all the qualities of being a Receiver ; intelligence , integrity , courage , and so forth (page 62). For differences , Giver is definitely older than Jonas (page 75). Again , another difference is that Giver has a spouse , but Jonas has no spouse , in chapter 13 ; page 102.  

Although many differences are found in the compare and contrast , similarities are also found. Even though Jonas is the current Receiver , instead of calling the old Receiver  current , they make him the Giver. Knowing that they still have the same job, the Giver understood more.( pages 74 - 107) .Making sure that Jonas has enough learning materials to be successful , Giver does do well but not perfect. Sometimes , he puts a bad memory of pain and anguish into Jonas because it is hurting him , and then he realizes that he's done wrong by making a mistake of putting the thought of warfare into Jonas's mind. 

Jonas will get all the memories from the Giver and there is only 1 memory of one place at one time (page 87). There can be a difference between the Giver and Jonas just because of how one is more wise than the other ; or intelligent , or integrity. Also there can be a similarity in how they picture things with color ; the flash of color , not perfectly solid , but they can still see it . Even if they could see beyond, they are all still similar to each other.",
10/7/2014 17:49:46,"Rosengren, Eric",The Giver,"Jonas and the Giver both have differences, and similarities, here are some of those. First, there is the obvious age gap between the Giver and Jonas.The Giver also has more memories than Jonas and more experience. The Giver and Jonas (as a similarity) were also both selected (ch. 8 pg. 60) and both have the capacity to see beyond. Jonas is less experienced with that kind of work and has a little difficulty with recalling memories (ch. 12 ph. 93). Jonas sort of ""acts before he thinks."" An example would be an example in chapter 13 is when he thought people should be able to make their own choices, but the Giver told him that people could make bad choices. Jonas is still living with his parents and his sister, Lily. The Giver can also turn his speaker on and off. One of the major differences is that the Giver gives the memories and the receiver (Jonas) receives them. Lastly, one of the similarities is the pale eyes.

10/7/2014 18:01:33,"Hughes, Jill",Jonas Versus the Giver,"     Jonas and the Giver are alike yet different in many ways. First of all, Jonas and the Giver both have the capacity to see the colour red. (p. 94) Also, Jonas and the Giver both have pale eyes.(p. 75) Even though Jonas and the Giver are very similar, the two individuals are also very different. For example, Jonas is young and the Giver is old. (p. 75) In addition to that, Jonas can only see the colour red, but the Giver can see every single colour. (p. 95)
     The Giver and Jonas are very similar. They both can see the colour red. That is very strange in their society because most people can not see any colour at all.(p. 99) Clearly, both Jonas and the Giver are very special. Also, Jonas and the Giver both have pale eyes, which is also unusual in their society.(p. 75)This states that only the people with pale eyes can see colour. 
     Even though the Giver and Jonas are very similar, they also are very different. For example, Jonas is young and the Giver is old.(p. 75) The Giver needs to be old because he needs to have the experience of being the Giver so he can make Jonas a fantastic Giver. Because of this, Jonas can only see limited colour, while the Giver can see all of the colours.(p.95) The Giver should be able to see all the colours because he is very experienced at being the Giver and should be rewarded with being special and seeing all the colours.That is how Jonas and the Giver are very alike, yet very different.","ISBN: 9780440237686

the Giver. First Jonas has the attributes to be selected to be the giver. The attributes are integrity, intelligence, the capacity of seeing beyond, and wisdom which Jonas has not acquired yet, but will during his training. In the book the Giver said, ""There were a lot of colors, and one of them is red. That's the one you are starting to see. Your friend Fiona has red hair-quite distinctive, actually; I have noticed it before."" This means they both have seen red before. They were both excited for the first day of training. After the current failure of the person who was supposed to give memories to Jonas, Rosemary, the people added a new rule which is that Receiver of Memory may not apply for release which Jonas and the giver must follow. 
                                                    Within this paragraph, we shall cover some differences that Jonas and the giver have. One difference Jonas and the giver have is that the giver has more knowledge about life. Jonas also said,"" But I want them! It is not fair that nothing has color!"". This means more of an arguer than the giver. Giver always wants an in depth explanation for everything Jonas argues about.
                                                  In these to paragraphs we have learned about some characteristics the Giver and Jonas. Jonas is naïve. He is also very mad about the elders taking all the color and geographical features such as hills, slopes, and mountains. The giver I more neutral. This man is very special because he can withstand the memories of pain. These are some of the differences and comparisons of the giver and Jonas.","The Giver pgs.62,63, and 94"
10/7/2014 20:30:41,"Heredia, Linda",Giver and Jonas compare and contrast,"Jonas and the Giver are very different. Jonas has the ability to see beyond and instead, the Giver has the ability to hear beyond. Both of their abilities came around the same age. This age was twelve years old. Jonas first started seeing the color red. He did not know what it was or what it meant but he knew objects just kept changing. The very first object that he saw change was the apple. The Giver loses energy when he transmits memories. Jonas instead feels livelier when he got all of those good memories from the Giver. When Jonas got the memories of sledding and of sunshine he had all these questions. Instead when he gets the memory of sunburn he says it hurts. The Giver is much older than Jonas especially with the years to make up for the previous failure to train the person who was supposed to be the next Giver.
The ways that Jonas and the Giver are similar is that they both have pale eyes. When Jonas first saw the Giver he noticed almost immediately that they had the same pale eyes. Jonas and the Giver also have the ability to do “something beyond”. For Jonas he can see beyond and for the Giver he can hear beyond.
Jonas doesn’t like being rude and sometimes he asks rude questions but the Giver always encourages his questions. Jonas is unsure of if he wants a spouse but when he asks the Giver he finds it is allowed. The Giver had a spouse and daughter but he warned Jonas that it would be tough because you couldn’t talk about work or share books, and it was just very hard to have a family when you are the Giver. Jonas wonders about the Givers wife and the Giver tells him she lives with the Childless Adults now.

        The giver and Jonas both have similarities, but some also lead to differences.  Jonas and the Giver both have pale eyes which is stated on page 76.  This means that they can both see color.  An extension to that is they both can see beyond which is stated on page 95.  But it also says on page 175 that the Giver can hear beyond, which means that he can hear music, but Jonas never gets that memory.  Clearly we know that they both have the same job, but, Jonas doesn’t quite understand the pain that he is going to get.  For example, after getting sunburnt, Jonas still walks out of the room thinking, “wow if that is pain I am well prepared and should not be scared.”  However a couple chapters later, specifically on pages 118 and 119, Jonas takes a painful memory of thirst, off the Givers hands, and then doesn’t want to go back to receive more memories.
        Jonas and the Giver, at the ceremony of the twelves, both received only one page in an otherwise very empty binder. The rules were that they couldn’t discuss their training with anyone, even if they wanted to they couldn’t.  Jonas says, on page 89, that if he did try to discuss his training, how could you describe snow to someone who has never felt cold before?  The same thing applies with color.  If you haven’t seen red, how can you describe red in a world of no color?  Also, Jonas and the Giver can’t apply for medication.  They are both allowed to lie, and Jonas said on page 71 that he could ask his father perhaps “do you lie?”  But he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received was true.  The only difference on the sheet is the release, which happens to do with the failure.
        In the end, I think that the giver and Jonas are much the same.  The Giver did a good job picking Jonas, and I know that he picked him for a reason.  They both were the same.  He hadn’t even shaken his hand, but he knew it was him.  If they didn’t have similarities, and differences, I don’t think this would be a good book.  There are many similarities to tell, but these are the main ones that I like, and were the ones the giver needed to choose Jonas.

10/8/2014 16:25:02,"Stewart, Kaelin",The Giver and Jonas,"     In the book ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry, There are two important characters: Jonas, A twelve year old boy, and the Giver, a man with memories of the past. Jonas and the Giver are alike in someways, but are also different. This essay will be all about comparing and contrasting Jonas and the Giver.
     First of all, the main similarity between Jonas and the Giver is that they were(are) both Receivers. The Giver was a Receiver before Jonas, but Jonas is the current receiver in the book. Being both Receivers, they both had the ""capacity to see beyond."" the ""capacity to see beyond"" is most likely related to seeing color. Seeing color is another similarity. The Giver can see everything in color effortlessly, but Jonas can only see some color at some times - that's only because he's just learning. They both have pale eyes, with might also be related to the ""capacity to see beyond. 
     As previously stated, Jonas is only a Twelve. The Giver, on the other hand, is older, but the readers don't know by how much. He is older, therefore more experienced than Jonas, especially in the subject ""exemption of rudeness"". Jonas is very new to the concept of asking questions that may not be polite and lying, while the Giver is so used to it, it doesn't phase him at all.
      These are the similarities and differences between the Giver and Jonas. As you can tell, they are alike in many ways, but also different. There are many more comparisons and contrasts, so be on the look out while finishing the book.",
10/8/2014 17:53:39,"Salvacion, Mykaela Antonette",Compare and Contrast: Jonas and the Giver,"        While some differences between Jonas and the Giver are evident, the similarities are striking. One similarity that they both share is their pale eyes (pgs. 20 & 61). Everyone else in the community has dark eyes, with the exception of a few (pg. 20). This is a symbol that they both have the ability to “see-beyond” (pg. 63). Another similarity the Giver and Jonas share is the honor and separation from the community. When Jonas is selected to become the Receiver of Memory, he immediately senses that he is different from the rest of the community, and this puts him at unease (pg. 65). Since the Giver is also the Receiver of Memory, he also is different and separate from the community, though he is more used to this. These were some similarities between Jonas and the Giver.
	The differences between Jonas and the Giver are pronounced, and they merit thorough examination. One difference they both have is their reaction to being separate from the community. The Giver is used to this, since he had much more training than Jonas, and does not seem bothered by it (pgs. 103 & 104). On the other hand, Jonas is nervous, because throughout his whole life he has learned that differences were considered to be wrong (pgs. 38 & 65). A second difference between the Giver and Jonas is that they both experienced the “Capacity to See Beyond” but in different ways (pg. 92). When Jonas got his first signs of the Capacity to See Beyond, what he saw was the color red (pg. 94). The Giver, however, explains that his seeing-beyond happened to him in a different way, which he will tell Jonas what it exactly is later (pg. 96). These were some differences between Jonas and the Giver.
	Although they have some major similarities, the differences between Jonas and the Giver are remarkable as well. Jonas and the Giver share both physical similarities and emotional similarities. Both have pale eyes, which means they can both see beyond (pg. 20 & 61). The Giver and Jonas are physically separate from the community because they train alone with only each other, and they are not allowed to share it with anybody (pgs. 61 & 68). They are emotionally separate from the community because, since they are not allowed to share their training with anybody, only they know the true pleasures and pains of life and that the world was different “back and back and back” (pgs. 94 – 107). Of course, the Giver and Jonas are different in many ways as well. For example, they “see-beyond” for the first time differently (pg. 92). “Seeing-beyond” for Jonas first happens when he sees a flash of red in an apple, which slowly begins to occur in other objects, such as the audience at the annual Ceremony and Fiona’s hair (pg. 94). However, later in the book, the Giver explains to Jonas that he “hears-beyond” for the first time, and when Jonas asks him what he hears, he says he hears music (pg. 157). In conclusion, the Giver and Jonas share many similarities and differences.

10/8/2014 18:47:38,"Colondres, Sebastian",How Jonas and the Giver are similar and different,"     In the Giver, Jonas is the main character who is chosen to be the next Reciever of memory, and he must be trained by the Giver (pg.76). They are very different, like how the Giver has more luxury furniture in the annex than Jonas does in his dwelling (pg.93), or that the Giver seems very old, and Jonas looks young (pg.96). The Giver and Jonas are also similar, in that they both are intelligent (pg.78), and that they both have pale eyes (pg.95). As you can see, they both are different and similar. Now, let's go and compare and contrast the Giver and Jonas!

     The Giver and Jonas are similar and different in many ways. One way they are similar is that they both have pale eyes (pg.95). Another way they are similar is that they both are intelligent (pg.78). Two more ways the Giver and Jonas are similar are that they both see color (pg.119), and that they both have experienced at least one memory (pg.104). They are also very different in many ways. Some ways that they are different is that the Giver has many books and Jonas doesn't (pg.94), and the Giver has very luxurious furniture, but Jonas doesn't (pg.93). Other ways they are different are that the Giver looks very old, while Jonas looks young (pg.96), and that the doors that lead to the Giver's room are locked, and none of the other doors in the community are locked (pg.92). That's some of the many differences and similarities between the Giver and Jonas. Now let's do some review!

     Since we have finished deeply comparing and contrasting the Giver and Jonas, let's review. The Giver and Jonas both can see color (pg.119), and both have experienced memories (pg.104). They are different in that the Giver has many books and luxurious furniture items, while Jonas doesn't have many books or any luxurious furniture items (pg.93-94). As you can see, the Giver and Jonas are similar and different in many ways.","Giver, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 1993"
10/9/2014 20:47:56,"Moshkriz, Ashley",Differences between Jonas and The Giver,"    Despite bearing some minor similarities the differences between the Giver and Jonas are remarkable. Jonas sees in black and white (although he has been started seeing the colors, I am talking about before chapter 13.) This is difference because The Giver sees in color.(page 95) Also The Giver holds all the memories. While The Receiver does not hold these memories (which is why the Giver trains Jonas) (This is discussed throughout the chapter.) 

These are just a few reasons how The Giver and Jonas are different, let me tell a few more reasons. Jonas is way younger than the Giver. Jonas is a twelve. The Giver was a twelve(pg 60)  then he was the receiver now he's a Giver is after the receiver. (Context clues tell you this.) 

Finally I have a few more differences I would like to discuss. The Giver has a spouse and Jonas does not(pg 102 Givers spouse was discussed.) Jonas obviously does not have a spouse (since he's a twelve) Another difference between them is that The Giver has a beard and Jonas does not (you can see The Giver on the cover.)Jonas does not have a beard because he's only twelve and he has not aged like The Giver. This is easy to figure out by context clues. These were a few differences between Jonas and The Giver. 
 
Lastly let us talk about the similarities between The Giver and Jonas. The Giver and Jonas both have pale eyes (page 95). Which brings me up to the question of does the pale eye color have to do with anything? Maybe that the pale eyed people are people who hold memories? In this book I have not found out the answer to this question.

Another similarity that The Giver and Jonas have is that Jonas and The Giver were both recievers. We don't quite know about this but we can infer that The Giver was a Reciever before he became The Giver.We know that Jonas recently turned into a twelve (pg 64). These are just a few things about the similarities and differences of The Giver and Jonas. ",
10/8/2014 19:37:12,"Song, Michael",Compare and Contrast with Jonas and the Giver,"     There are many similarities and differences between the Giver and Jonas.These are only a few common and different things about them.One similarity is that they both have pale eyes(p.61).A difference that they have is that the Giver is obviously old(p.75).There are still more similarities and differences.

     Jonas and the Giver have many differences.On differences they have is that Jonas lives in a dwelling and the Giver lives in the Annex room(p.74).The Giver is obviously old(p.75).Also the Giver can hear beyond but Jonas can see beyond.Another difference is that the Giver can transmit memories but Jonas at the moment can only receive the memories.These are some of the few differences between Jonas and the Giver.

     There are a lot of similarities with the Giver and Jonas.One similarity is that Jonas and the Giver were the Receiver of Memory(p.61).Jonas also have pale eyes like the Giver(p.61).Soon after Jonas is done with training he will have to train the next Receiver of Memory just like the Giver training Jonas at the moment.After Jonas is done with training he will also live in the Annex room alone like the Giver right now.There are more similarities but these are only a few similarities.

     These are only a few similarities and differences.The Giver can hear beyond but Jonas can see beyond.One similarity is that Jonas will live in the Annex room one day forever.The Giver gives memories to Jonas of the true pain and pleasure of life.Jonas is a Twelve that is now the new Receiver of Memory.Now you know the similarities and differences against Jonas and the Giver.","Book title:The Giver

10/8/2014 20:25:40,"Bensa, Emilija",The Giver and Jonas,"  The Giver and Jonas are different in a few ways. Jonas is always high-tempered, and the Giver is very calm and quiet. While Jonas feels pain in and after his memories,  the Giver, although, gets the pain at any sudden time.

  Jonas is always amazed, interested, and has many questions about his training. He is almost always high- tempered and ""ready to go"" kind of person( escpecially when it comes to his training). When Jonas leaves his training, however, he isnt allowed to tell anybody about how it went that day. The days when the Giver is in pain ( pg.106 Ch. 13 )Jonas has to leave and come back another day. On those days, Jonas is worried and disapointed.

  The Giver is a very old, calm, quiet, easy going person. He almost alway answers Jonas's questions( exept for the day when Jonas asked him "" Giver, what causes you pain?"" ( pg. 107 Ch. 13). The Giver, however that day said, "" Lie down, it's time, I suppose. I can't shield you forever. You' ll hve to take it all on eventually."" ( pg. 107 Ch. 13). Jonas and the Giver are different in quite a way.",
10/8/2014 20:39:24,"Gressler, Emma","The young, naive Jonas versus the old, wise Giver","   The Giver and Jonas have some similarities and minor differences. Jonas, the new 12 year old receiver of memory (page 60), has yet to accept the ways of Sameness (page 94). The Giver, on the other hand, is older and wise, and understands the harsh ways the community (page 107). Although there are many differences, Jonas and the Giver share one thing in common: Jonas and the Giver are the Receivers of Memory. In conclusion, the Giver and Jonas have many similarities and differences.
     
  An obvious variation between the Giver and Jonas is their ages. The Giver is an old man who had a life of pain and suffering, both physical and emotional, to hold the community’s memories (page 82). The Giver also needs lots of energy to give Jonas memories. Jonas is a 12 year old boy who has lots of energy and is eager to learn about the past and hidden secrets about the community (page 97). When Jonas asks a question or is curious about the past, the Giver usually responds with, “Another day” (page 106).  As a result, there is a large age difference 
between the Giver and Jonas.                                                        

  Another relationship between the Giver and Jonas is that they both are 
Receivers of Memory. The group of elders cannot explain how they recognize this distinction, but they call it the ""Capacity to See Beyond"" and consider it as an ability that will be essential for the new Receiver of Memory (page 63). As the one who is responsible for providing advice to the elders when decisions must be made using information from the past, the Receiver needs to be able to see in a different way than any of the other residents of the community. Another similarity between the Giver and Jonas has pale eyes (page 94). The Giver explains to Jonas that since his eyes are pale, he can see the color red better. These are just a few explanations of how Jonas and the Giver are similar.			                                  											
       Lastly, the Giver and Jonas both agree that the community should get rid of the idea of Sameness (page 95). When Jonas asked the Giver why there is no snow, sunburn, or sunrise (page 95). The Giver said that due to Climate Control, the community had to switch to Sameness (page 98). Jonas thinks the idea of Sameness is terrible, cruel and unjust system, while The Giver just plays along with it. 								   
         
     The Giver and Jonas have several similarities and minor variations. The Giver and Jonas both share the trait of pale eyes,(page 94) both are Receivers of Memory and they both agree that the idea of Sameness (page 95) is cruel. The Giver and Jonas both vary in age, a twelve year old versus an elder   (page 102). Although The Giver and Jonas vary in age, Jonas and The Giver are very similar.

10/8/2014 20:56:16,"Chen, Michael",Comparing and Contrasting Jonas with the Current Giver,"     The differences between Jonas and the current Giver are striking, and they deserve thorough examination. One main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is that Jonas comes to quick conclusions, but the current Giver does not. For example (pg.95), when the Giver says,”We gained control of many things. But we had to let go of others,” Jonas says,”We shouldn’t have!” This shows that Jonas has strong emotions, is not afraid to show what he wants, and comes to quick conclusions. After that, the Giver says (pg. 95),” You’ve come quickly to that conclusion. It took me many years. Maybe your wisdom will come much more quickly than mine.” This also shows that Jonas has quick and accurate conclusions and learns quickly, but it also shows that the Giver did not have those skills when he was young. That is why one main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is that Jonas comes to quick conclusions, but the Giver does not.
     Another main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is how enthusiastic they are about the training. For example (pg. 85), Jonas insists on feeling some pain, but the Giver says that it is not necessary yet. This means that Jonas is very excited and optimistic about the training, but the Giver is very careful because of the earlier failure. Also (pg. 107), on a day after one that he had been sent away on, he asks the Giver what causes him pain. He tells him to give him some of it so he does not feel as much. That is why the extent of enthusiasm about training is a main difference between Jonas and the current Giver.
     A third main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is how they respond to events in their life. For example, as stated earlier (pg. 95), when the Giver says,” We gained control of many things. But we had to let go of others,” Jonas says, “We shouldn’t have!” The Giver is calm and placid, but Jonas is excited and provoked. It is the same thing with the training. Jonas is excited and optimistic about the training, but the Giver is cautious and discreet about it because of the earlier failure. In the book, it says (pg. 97), “The Giver told him it would be a very long time before he had the colors to keep. ‘But I want them!’ Jonas said angrily. ‘It isn’t fair that nothing has color!’ ‘Not fair?’ The Giver looked at Jonas curiously. ’Explain what you mean.’ “Jonas is still excited and provoked while he talks, but the Giver is calm and tranquil. That is why I think a main difference between Jonas and the current Giver is how they respond to events in their life.

10/8/2014 21:00:36,"Thornton, Kyle",Giver compare and contrast,"Jonas and the Giver heave many differences.Some major difference is age.How we can tell there age is different is by the fact that the Giver is Jonas's mentor or teacher.Another difference is the first thing that happened when they were seeing/hearing beyond.
Jonas and the Giver have some more major differences. One of the differences is that when they got the feelings of beyond.When Jonas first saw beyond it was colors.When the Giver first saw beyond he heard music.
The Giver and Jonas also have many things in common. The Giver and Jonas have the same color eyes.Another way the Giver and Jonas are the same is by they fact they are both receivers of memory.The last difference i can think of is that they both want to be free of the wretched society.This concludes my essay on how Jonas and the Giver are the same and how they're different.",
10/8/2014 21:31:22,"Bensa, Emilija",The Giver and Jonas,"       The Giver and Jonas are different in a few ways. Jonas is a high-tempered and “ready to go” kind of person. On the other side, the Giver is an old and quiet man. Jonas has a lot of questions and is not shy to ask them. The Giver is pleased to answer all of his questions.

	Jonas is an excited, interested, and has lots of questions about his training. He always obeys on the Givers commands, and is eager to do them. Jonas experiences the same pain as the Giver does, but does not get them at random like the Giver does. During training everything goes as planned and they get their work done except for some days when the Giver is in pain and Jonas has to leave and come back tomorrow (pg. 106 Ch. 13). On those days, Jonas walks by the river alone, worried and disappointed that there was no training that day. 

	The Giver is an old, quiet, and calm man. He answers all of Jonas’s questions except for one which was “Giver, what causes you pain?”, asked Jonas one day. (pg. 107 Ch. 13) The Giver answered him “Lie down, it’s time, I suppose. I can’t shield you forever. You’ll have to take it all on eventually.” (pg. 107 Ch. 13) After transmitting the pain, afterwards, Jonas asks for a pill to kill the pain. The Giver said “No” (pg. 109 Ch. 14). These are only a few of differences how Jonas and the Giver are different.

Although they bear some minor similarities the differences between The Giver and Jonas are remarkable. The Giver and Jonas have similarities. But they also have differences that make them remarkable polar opposites. In this paragraph you will learn about what makes them remarkably different. The Giver is wise and Jonas is not as wise as The Giver. (pg. 86) The Giver has a spouse and Jonas does not. (pg. 102) Jonas has only three books in his dwelling. (pg. 74) The Giver has millions of books. (pg. 74) Those are the ways Jonas and The Giver are different.
The Giver and Jonas are in many ways different but they have lots of remarkable similarities. In this paragraph you will learn about the things The Giver and Jonas have in common. The Giver can transmit memories to people. (pg. 80, 81, and 82) Jonas can also transmit memories to people. (pg. 116) The Giver was frightened on his first day of training when he entered the annex room and examined the room with the previous receiver sitting in a chair watching him. (pg. 76) Jonas was also frightened when he entered the annex room for his first day of training. (pg. 76) Those are some ways The Giver and Jonas are alike.
       In conclusion The Giver and Jonas are alike in some ways, like they can both transmit memories to people which you will find on page one hundred and sixteen. But they are also remarkably different also like The Giver and Jonas were both scared on their first day of training when they entered the annex room, looked around and saw their trainer, The Giver\ Receiver of Memory which you will find on page seventy six. Those are all the ways The Giver and Jonas are alike and different.

10/8/2014 22:14:11,"Morrison, Audrey", Jonas Compared to The Giver,"
The differences between Jonas and the giver are pronounced. Jonas is in training to become the new receiver of memory and the current receiver of memory is already doing the job. The giver already knows all the memories where as Jonas does not, so the giver has to give him the memories. Jonas is beginning to see color and the giver already sees all the colors.

The giver started hearing music before he started seeing colors, but Jonas started seeing the color red before he heard music. When Jonas explained about him seeing the color red, the giver said he felt the same way. Jonas is very curious and the giver was not very curious. The giver is a lot older than Jonas and wiser. Jonas is still kind of working on the rules of his new selection where as the giver knows the rules well. The giver is more serious than Jonas. Jonas feels kind of weird in a way like everything is different and the giver is used to the situation.

Jonas is feeling trapped like he can’t describe his training and the giver is keeping everything good and not worrying about not telling people. The giver is very calm, but Jonas is still young and has energy. The current receiver of memory has to transport the memories to Jonas because Jonas doesn’t know the memories and he has to have them to be the receiver of memory. Jonas is learning still and has a long way to go where as the giver has already learned all the memories.

10/9/2014 15:47:50,"Thomas, Elyssa",is this my world?,   The difference between Jonas and the Giver are shocking.  First both of the giver and Jonas have pale eyes.  They can also see colors of the world surrounding them.  The Giver has read books and can give memories to Jonas.  Jonas and the Giver can lie and break the rules.  Also of course the current Giver is older than Jonas.  those are some reasons of Jonas and the current Giver's differences and similarities.,  Jonas has a family and the Giver does not.  Well as much as we know the Giver.  
10/9/2014 17:00:11,"Morrison, Eliza",Jonas and The Giver,"Although they bear some superficial similarities, the differences between Jonas and the current Giver are pronounced. First I will mention that the current giver is old and Jonas is young. Also that the current giver has more experience than Jonas and knows more stuff about being the reciver of memory ( the Giver ). I will also state that Jonas has a family unit and the Giver does not ( the Giver has a wife and had a family unit but his kids are all grown up so they no longer have to live with their parents and move out, but Jonas is still young and still lives with his family unit ).
While some differences between Jonas and the current Giver are evident, the similarities are striking. One of the similarities between Jonas and the current Giver are that they both have pale eyes ( which, in my prediction, means that the people with pale eyes are the people who can see color more clearly ). Also they can both now see the memories of the past. Last, they both can see the memories when they are transmitted to them.
Some other minor things that the Giver and Jonas have in common and not in common is that Jonas just had his stirrings but the Giver had them a long time ago ( stirrings are when they feel love for another person and dream about them ). I guess that I will state another reason of how the Giver and Jonas contract. So another way that they contract is that the Giver has a beard and Jonas does not ( I hope, he is only twelve ). Another way that they contrast is that when the Giver lived the community had more freedom and the community had more mystical animals ""back in the day"". Now I should probably state a way that Jonas and the Giver have in common. So I will state first that Jonas has three kids in his family (Gabriell) and the Giver only had two, I think.",
10/9/2014 17:37:00,"Peppiatt, Lauren",Comparing and Contrasting,"They may bear some minor differences, but the similarities of Jonas and the Giver are interesting. First, the Giver and Jonas both have pale eyes. Also, they both started seeing red around the age of twelve. The Giver and Jonas are both brave, have wisdom, and are confident.  Finally, they see memories no one else can see. Those are a few similarities comparing Jonas and the Giver.
Jonas and the Giver have a few differences too. One of the differences is that the Giver's first transfered memory was music and Jonas's was snow.  Another difference is that the Giver is older than Jonas.  Jonas complains about many different things and the Giver doesn't complain at all! These are some of the differences between Jonas and the Giver.
In conclusion, you now know the similarities and differences between the Giver and Jonas. A similarity is that they both have pale eyes. Also, a difference is that the Giver received the memory of music first, but Jonas received the memory of snow. This information has taught you about comparing and contrasting  Jonas and the Giver.",
10/9/2014 17:42:09,"Mulford, Nicholas",Jonas and the Giver,"Although Jonas and the Giver are different,they have many similarities. For example,one reason Jonas and the Giver are different is that the Giver is old,while Jonas is only twelve.However,both the Giver and Jonas have pale eyes (page 76) ""It was a man Jonas had not noticed before,a bearded man with pale eyes"".Also,both Jonas and the Giver have something called ""Seeing the Beyond"" a mysterious quality that only they share.However,it is only mysterious to other citizens who went to Sameness,because Capacity To See Beyond is seeing color,mysterious to citizens because they went to Sameness,something based on everything and everyone being alike.(Page 79) ""He calls it the Capacity to See Beyond"". Although those are similarities,Jonas and the current Giver,or Receiver, still have many differences from one another.
   Although they have similarities,Jonas and the current Giver are still very different. For example,the Giver is already a Receiver of Memory,while Jonas is still training for this job.Another difference is that the Giver did not experience the ""Capacity to See Beyond"" in the same way Jonas did,but he does not say how he experienced it,saying that Jonas would not understand yet.(Page 116) ""When I was your age-about to become the new Receiver-I began to experience it,though it took a different form.With me it was...well, I won't describe that now; you wouldn't understand it yet.""Another difference is that the current Giver already has every single memory,but Jonas still needs to receive all of them.And,yet another difference is that the giver can see all the colors,while Jonas cannot yet.(Page 120) ""Do you see it all the time?"" ""I see all of them.All the colors."" Another way the Giver and Jonas are different is that the Giver is consulted by the Elders,where Jonas is not,as he just started his training.""The Committee of Elders sought my advice"".(Page 140) Those are many reasons Jonas and the current Giver of the Community are different from each other.
      The Giver and Jonas have many similarities,like that of the Capacity to Beyond ,their eyes,and the fact that they are both Receivers.But still,they have many differences such as their age,how they experienced the Capacity to See Beyond,and the difference that the Giver is actual Receiver,whereas Jonas is preparing to become one.So,Jonas and the Giver have some similarities,but they are still very,very different from one another. And those are some facts about why Jonas and the Giver in the book,The Giver,have similarities and differences.",
10/9/2014 17:55:18,"Jensen, Samantha",Jonas and the Giver,"        While some differences between Jonas and the Giver are evident, the similarities are salient. Both have the capacity to see beyond. One and the other become angry at sameness. Even though the Giver started training differently than Jonas, the pair shares the same painful destiny.
        To see beyond one must have pale eyes. Having pale eyes gives someone the ability to receive memories, and to see things as they once were.Jonas and the giver have pale eyes.”Jonas looked self-consciously into the pale eyes that mirrored his own”(p.75).
	Sameness is a way to try to make things fair by making every thing the same. In sameness there are no colors, no sunshine, and no choices. The new receiver and the old one know how things used to be. They are angry because both know what could be.”We gained control of many things. But we had had to let go of  others.””we shouldn’t have!” Jonas shouted fiercely(p.95).They call sameness unfair.
	When the Giver started training, instead of seeing colors he began to hear music. Despite that their lives are set to receive memories of the past to give guidance to the elders when necessary.",
10/9/2014 18:09:28,"Brown, Rachel",Jonas and The Giver,"   The Giver and Jonas have many differences.  The Giver has a lot more knowledge than Jonas.  They are of age difference.  One has more memories.  They have there differences.  

 The Giver has been Reciver for a lot longer than Jonas.  The Giver looks more aged than Jonas does, yet The Giver is not as old as old as Jonas perceves him to be.  The Giver, of course, has a lot more memories than Jonas.  Jonas is just learning. 

  The Giver and Jonas are very different.  The Giver knows a lot more than Jonas. They have a very big age gap. One holds more memories then the other. That is why they are different.",
10/9/2014 18:25:16,"Trinh, Aaron",The Differences and Similarities Between Jonas and the Current Giver,"      There are differences and similarities between Jonas and the current Giver. One difference between them is that Jonas is less experienced than The Giver. Jonas was selected to be the new Receiver of Memory because he had pale eyes and the Elders believed that Jonas had the Capacity to See Beyond (p. 63). When Jonas first obtained memories from The Giver, he was not able to see all colors yet because he still needed more training to develop that skill (p. 95). Eventually, Jonas will be as skilled as the current Giver.
      Another difference is that the current Giver had more knowledge than Jonas. Jonas was not capable of describing what happened to Fiona’s hair, but The Giver recognized that Jonas was beginning to see the color red (p. 90, 94). Additionally, when The Giver asked Jonas to look at the red books in the bookshelf behind him, he saw the same change in appearance as Fiona’s hair. The current Giver explained that once there were many colors. Because everyone devoted to a life of Sameness, which means that almost everybody has the same skin color and hair color, the community got rid of seeing any colors (p. 95). The rare exceptions are Fiona’s red hair and that everybody with pale eyes could see more color as they age than the citizens with dark colored eyes (p. 95).
      Moreover, Jonas and The Giver both have things in common. For instance, both of them are restricted from medication associated with their training (p. 68). In addition, Jonas and the current Giver are exempted from rules governing rudeness. They can ask any question to anyone and they will get an answer (p. 95). Another example is that both of them may not discuss their work with any other person of the community. Furthermore, they are forbidden from dream-telling, not allowed to apply for release, and may tell lies (p. 68). As you can see, there are many ways in which The Giver is the same and different than Jonas.

10/9/2014 18:42:05,"Bowers, Jonathon",The Giver Compare and Contrast,"Some similarities between The Giver and Jonus are... The Giver and Jonus are they can both deliver memories to people.They can also see all the colors and that important because in their world the people can only see black and white.And when Jonus gets older he will get the memories from The Giver so Jonus can pass them down the the next receiver,which will probably be Gabe.


Some contrasts between The giver and Jonus are ....The Giver have bin trained for many years and Jonus have been trianing for a short peroid of time.Jonus have not had much pain yet but The Giver have had much pain over the years.Even when he is not training.

The Giver is more wize and has more wizdom than Jonas.The Elders go to  The Giver or The Receiver of Memory for guidance 
and answers about the past and in there problems in the present . They play an important role in their society. ",
10/9/2014 18:34:32,"Mulford, Benjamin",The Two Receivers,"Although they have similar traits, the Giver and Jonas are quite different.They,for example, both have the Capacity to See Beyond. the Capacity to See Beyond is first described by the Chief Elder,(page 79),when she says ,""He calls it the Capacity to See Beyond."" Not only do they both have this unusual quality, but they both have the strange pale eyes, found in very few members of the community. Jonas, from the start of the book, is said to have these odd eyes. For the Giver, it introduces that he has these eyes too, (page 95), where it says, "" The man was wrinkled, and his eyes, though piercing in their unusual lightness, seemed tired."" Also, both the Giver and Jonas are Receivers, or at least have been Receivers during a certain time period.Jonas,though, being the current Receiver, a strange job only certain citizens of the community are selected for,is taught by the Giver illustrating a fairly important difference.
   Though Jonas and the Giver are similar in all those ways, they are not as alike as they may seem. An example of these differences is age. It does not say the Givers age, yet it does say that he old. As for Jonas, when the Giver and Jonas first formally meet; as the Giver has access to everything in the community, and has likely known about Jonas for many, many, years; Jonas is at the age of 12, when he first gets his job, and becomes the brand-new Receiver. Another difference is who holds the memories. An example of this would be Jonas's first day in the Annex room. During this mostly explanatory lesson,the book says,(page 97) ""Simply stated,"" he said, ""although its not really simple at all, my job is to transmit to you all the memories i have within me.Memories of the past."" While this makes absolutely no sense at all to Jonas at the time, he later discovers that it means the Giver holds the memories, and the Receiver must get these memories, or the community will plunge into chaos. After all, the community has not received its entire life of training on how to hold these memories.
   Basically, the Giver and Jonas have many similarities. But no two people can be exactly alike. The Giver and Jonas are a great example of this. Age,personality,honor,and power can make them different. That is how the Giver and Jonas, though bearing different and similar characteristics, are not the same.",
10/9/2014 18:35:51,"Carsten, Alexander",Compare and Contrast: Jonas and the Giver,"    While some differences between the Giver and Jonas are evident the similarities are striking. Jonas and the Giver are quite different in many  ways.  One difference is obvious, the Giver is a lot older than Jonas but there are other differences between them (pg. 76).  Another difference is how much they know; the Giver, most likely, has had much more experience with the pain of the knowledge while Jonas has nearly just started with his training.  Also the Giver knows more about how to train the next Receiver because 10 years before Jonas there was a failure in the training(pg. 56-57).  Where as Jonas has only transferred memories to Gabe to help him sleep(pg. 146-147).  There may be other differences in The Giver.
  There are many similarities between the Giver and Jonas.  One of which is the fact that they both have pale eyes(pg. 25 and 76)  which is rare in the Giver's society(pg. 25).  This may be a way to tell if they can be transferred memories.  Also, they are the only two in the society that have experienced real pain.  This may be because the Elders do not want anyone ,but who has to, to experience real pain.  These were some of the similarities of Jonas and the Giver.
  There are many other similarities between the Giver and Jonas. One is is that they are the only ones who know what had happened many, many years ago when it was like it is in real life.  This may be to keep everyone from knowing about the wars and ""bad"" things that had happened.  While doing this the Elders take away the ""good"" stuff that had happened.  Another similarity is that both of them have Received and Given memories: when Jonas Received his first memory(pg. 102-104), when Jonas gave a memory to Gabe(pg. 147), the Giver was trained by the last Giver, and when the Giver gave Jonas his first memory(pg. 102-104). These were the last similarities between Jonas and the Giver.","Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt

10/9/2014 19:06:15,"Kellam, Tabitha",Compare and Contrast,"A few similarities I  have between the Giver an Jonas are 1. they both were receivers the Giver was the current receiver and Jonas is the new receiver. 2. the Giver an Jonas can both see color which means "" seeing beyond "". 3. They both have had the feeling of pain and happiness like the feeling of sunburn and the feeling of the sled and the snow. Those kinds of things. 4. A major similarity they have is they both have pale eyes.





Now, I want to get into some differences they have together. 1. the Giver and Jonas have a difference between young and old. Jonas is young and the Giver is old that is a major difference. 2. another difference is their eyes again, but the Giver's eyes are droopy from receiving all of the memories and Jonas's eyes are not. 3. one more difference I think they have is the Giver is going to probably get released after he trains Jonas and Jonas will not get released for a long time.


Those are the things I wanted to compare and contrast with the Giver and Jonas.  ",
10/9/2014 19:11:56,"Dagenais, Julianna",Jonas and the Giver,"Jonas and the current Giver have some similarities, but they also have differences. For example, Jonas and the Giver were both receivers at a time. A difference would include the current Giver having a lot of memories, but Jonas does not have as many. The Giver gives the memories, and Jonas receives them.

There are many similarities with Jonas and the current Giver. Jonas is the receiver. The current Giver was once the receiver. He was once training like Jonas but with a different teacher. Jonas has practically no memories. The Giver gives them to him. Jonas will be a Giver soon. But without the Giver, Jonas would not have gotten a job.


The Giver and Jonas also have some differences. The Giver is old, but Jonas is young. The Giver teaches and Jonas learns. If Jonas were to teach and the Giver learns, nothing would make sense. It is kind of like a class of thirty students teaching the teacher how to find a transitive verb. The kids would not make any sense. The Giver has memories from his teacher, and Jonas only has two memories from the current Giver.

Those are some of the similarities and differences between the Giver and Jonas. There are probably a whole lot more, but I can not list all of them. More like that the Giver is on the council of elders and Jonas is just a twelve, training to be the next Giver. Also, The Giver has already gone through school while Jonas is still in school. Jonas is just starting to see red, like in Fiona's hair. The Giver can see all colors and know what they are. Those were my three paragraphs on the similarities and differences between the Giver and Jonas.",
10/9/2014 19:20:40,"Schiazzano, Nicole",How Jonas and the Giver are Different and Similar,"   The differences between Jonas and the Giver are pronounced but their differences are obvious. So first I will tell you about how they are similar. They are both similar because the both obviously have the ability to See Beyond. Another similarity between Jonas and the Giver is that they both have pale eyes which is very uncommon in the community.  They also both feel a bit left out because they can not really talk to anyone about their job or what they did. I would say that the Giver and Jonas have the same deamenor. I would also say that they are very alike because they seem to like the same things or have the same opinion on certain matters.
  The Giver and Jonas are also very different. For instance they both have the ability to See Beyond but in their own unique way. The Giver can See Beyond in terms of music whereas Jonas can See Beyond in terms of color. Jonas is also a young boy who is only twelve and the Giver is a much older person. The Giver is also apart of the group of Elders and is the most important one. Jonas is not an elder so he of course is not in the group of Elders.
   Their complexion for instance is also somewhat similar because they both have pale eyes. But that is not the only thing that makes them similar. They both think that is good and bad that there is Sameness. They think it is good because then they have more agricultural time and they do not have to expierience the parts of the year that are bad. They think it is bad because with Sameness you do not have any choices like you have the same color of gray for clothes every day instead of getting to choose whichever color that you want.",
10/9/2014 19:21:41,"Johnson, Mikaela",The giver society,"Jonas and the giver are different in multiple ways. To start the giver is old and Jonas is only twelve. The giver is calm and Jonas is lively.

There is a few similarities though. The giver and Jonas both have pale eyes and both are eager to learn.",

 To start, Jonas is ,of course ,younger.And he doesn't have a spouse.Jonas also just got his job as a reciever of memory so every thing is different now. Jonas doesn't have that memories as The Giver does.
 The Giver ,however is older than Jonas. He did have a spouse before.And the Giver was a receiver for a long time since the last receiver failed.He also has more wisdom than Jonas. And a lot more memories.

10/9/2014 19:39:16,"Fajardo, Nawel",Is the Giver the same as Jonas?,"While some differences between The Giver and Jonas are noticeable, the similarities are striking.
The differences between the main characters are numerous. First, the Giver is older than him but he still has “a good deal of time left” before being released (Ch. 10 p.76). Second, The Giver is a trainer but Jonas is more like a student and need to be trained by him (Ch.10 p.75-79). Third, The Giver has more experience than Jonas (Ch.11 p.80-87). Fourth, The Giver has lost a member of his family but Jonas hasn't (Ch.9 p.67). Finally, the Giver has a beard (Ch.8 p.61).
The similarities between them are located at various levels. First, we see The Giver for the first time at the Ceremony of Twelve, and Jonas notices that he has pale eyes, just like him, (Ch.10 p.75). Second, we see that they are both receivers of memories and this job is one of the most important in their society, it consists of watching memories from the past (Ch. 10 p.75-79). Third, they both have the capacity to perceive beyond and see things that other people cannot see. For example, they can see color and memories (Ch.12 p.94). Fourth, they both like the warm memory of love and family (Ch. 16 p.123-125). Finally, as the Giver, Jonas has experienced pain and happiness. An example of pain would be warfare or when the elephant was killed. And another for happiness would be the snow, family, love, and sledding (Ch.11, 15-16 pp.81-82,118-120,123-125).

10/9/2014 19:42:09,"Thaller, Lauren",compairing and contrasting the giver and jonas,"The Giver and Jonas are different yet the same in many ways. One similarity is that the have pale eyes. When Jonas first came into the Annex room he saw the Giver. When he was looking at the Giver he saw pale eyes, just like his own. Another is that they are both the reviver of memory. On the first day of Jonas's training  the Giver introduced himself. While introducing himself he said,"" I have been the   receiver of memory for a long time.
The Giver and Jonas are both experienced with pain. The chief elder said there would be pain. Also the Giver gives memories of pain to Jonas. Thus that means the Giver was already given the memory of pain just how Jonas learned pain. Now, something that is different between them is there age. The Giver is very old, yet he is not old enough to be released because he still needs to train Jonas. For Jonas he is at a young and healthy age of twelve.
Another difference is their different family units in the community. They both have different parents and siblings. while Jonas still lives and goes back to his family the Giver does not stay with a family unit any more, but, he stays by himself. The last difference is that the Giver has experienced a loss of a love one or anyone without having them released. He is the only one in the community that had loss anyone. While Jonas has not lost a anyone related or non-related to him making them different.

The Giver and Jonas have multiple traits they share, and they are required to go through similar situations. But there are some things different between them as well. Here are some examples.
     There are multiple obvious traits that the Giver and Jonas do not have in common. For example, the Giver is much older than Jonas, and is wiser. Also the Giver has a wife and is much more mature and sophisticated. Very little major things are different about them. One of the most important differences between the giver and Jonas is how they first experienced their power of “seeing beyond”. Jonas started by seeing colors, starting with red, and the Giver saw it in a different way, which comes later in the book.  There is probably smaller details like that, but overall, the Giver and Jonas are very much the same.
       The society has very strong requirements for the job of the Giver and the Receiver. Therefore, automatically making Jonas and the Giver resemble each other.  Jonas and the Giver both have the ability to ""see beyond"" even though they started seeing it in different ways, which is why they were selected for the job. And because of their job, they are able to bond, and agree on many things concerning it. Mostly the Giver and Jonas are extremely alike, and have very few differences.

10/9/2014 19:55:23,"Good, Kayla",Jonas vs. The Giver,"Although they bear some minor similarities, the differences between Jonas and the Giver are striking.  One difference is how much experience each of them have.  Jonas just started, but the Giver has been a receiver for many years.  Another difference is that Jonas is so much younger than the Giver.  My last difference is how each of them started “seeing beyond.”  As you can see, there are many differences between Jonas and the Giver.

Jonas and the Giver have different amounts of experience.  Like I said before, Jonas just started being the receiver, but the Giver has been the receiver for many years.  When the Elders go to the Giver for help, he can always find a memory that will help(page 111).  Jonas does not have very many memories yet, so he will not be able to help as much as the Giver can.  As you can see, the Giver and Jonas have different amounts of experience.

Jonas is many years younger than the Giver.  Jonas still goes to school before he goes to the Annex room to do training(page 89).  On the other hand, being a receiver is the Giver’s whole life(page 103).  Jonas still lives with his family, but the Giver lives by himself because he is so much older.  The Giver did have a family, but his wife lives with the childless adults(page 102).  As you can see, Jonas is much younger than the Giver.

The Giver and Jonas started “seeing beyond” differently.  Jonas realized he was seeing beyond when he saw objects change for a short period of time.  Later the Giver told him he was seeing colors(page 63).  The Giver started seeing beyond when he heard music.  As you can see, the Giver and Jonas started seeing things differently.

10/9/2014 19:56:32,"Strainer, Logan",Receiver and the Giver compare and contraste and contrast,"There are many differences between Jonas and the giver.  One difference between them is their seemingly huge age difference.  At twelve, Jonas is much younger than the giver. The giver’s ability to see life experiences makes it seem like he has lived forever.  The giver has no family unit. He lives in a library like house far away from others, while Jonas lives with a family unit in a dwelling located amongst other dwellings. The giver has the life experiences of all the givers before him. He is very bright and wise, while Jonas has little life experience to draw from so he doesn’t appear as bright and wise.  Jonas is more curious, and youthful.

Although, they are different, there are also many personal similarities between Jonas and the giver. The giver and Jonas have very pale eyes, eyes almost as white as a ghost. They also have the same exact birthmark on the upper part of the wrist, to secretly identify them as a receiver of memory, or the giver. When both of the receivers were young they were almost exact replicas of each other. That’s how Jonas and the giver have the same physical similarities.

Other examples of similarities are that they are both are very smart and one of the top students of their class.  Their ability to study their visions, makes them happy, at peace, yet trouble them and sometimes makes them unhappy. They are both also loving and care about other people because they hate the old world, are against killing, and releasing. The cool thing about the giver and Jonas is that they are both were receivers of memory for the town.  These are some of the similarities of the giver and Jonas.

10/9/2014 20:06:13,"Hillis, Isaac",The Similarities And Differences of The Giver And Jonas," The Giver and Jonas have their differences and similarities. This essay will help anyone who reads it learn and understand those differences and similarities. The next (first) paragraph will show and describe the similarities between The Giver and Jonas. The second paragraph will show and describe the differences between The Giver and Jonas.
   The Giver and Jonas have many similarities, physical mental, and more, so here are a few. The Giver, as well as Jonas, has pale eyes (pg. 61). Those pale eyes are probably what allows them to ""see beyond"", or, simply put, see colors. They both also have an important job, or role in the community as the Receiver of Memory (even though technically one is retired) (pg. 67). On top of that, just being the Receiver of Memory means you know lots of things, by receiving the memories (pg. ), and just by being a Receiver, because you have to be smart already just to become a Receiver (pg. 63). Those are a few of the similarities between The Giver and Jonas.
Now that some similarities have been described, let’s describe some differences. In case it was not stated clearly, The Giver looks very old (pg. 76), and Jonas does not. As of right now, Jonas can only see red, and The Giver can see all the colors (pg. 95). More on colors, Jonas can only see the color red sometimes, it flickers, but as for The Giver, he sees colors all the time (pg. 95). Another difference is that The Giver knows more about being a receiver, and has more memories (pg. 82). Those are just a few differences between The Giver and Jonas.",
10/9/2014 20:10:27,"Weil, Logan",Then Versus Now,"     I will be telling you the difference between Jonas's society and our modern society in 2014. One of the first differences is regarding what is taught. In our society we are taught a variety of subjects. For example, we are taught math, English, sciences, history, and many more. In Jonas's society they are taught English and math, but not to the same extent as us. In fact, they are mostly taught about precision of words.
     The second difference is the relationship of families. Our families are more close to each other. Their families are not as close as our modern society. Another thing that is different is that Jonas's society allows two children in each family. They also have to get an application approved to be allowed to receive children. Although in our families we can choose when we want children and how many children we want to have. 
     In this last paragraph I will continue and finish explaining the differences between Jonas's society and our modern day society. In Jonas's society, they have also made it so that their jobs are assigned to them by people called Elders. Meanwhile, we get to choose our jobs to the extent of who hires us and what is available. We don't have to get jobs, although modern society has made it very hard to survive without them. These are just a few differences of Jonas's society and our modern day society.","""They are taught mostly taught about the precision of words."" pg 54, 55

""They have also made it so that their jobs are assigned to them by people called Elders."" pg 19"
10/9/2014 20:14:52,"Marion, Alexander",Comparing Jonas and the current Giver,"     Although the Giver and Jonas bear minor similarities, the differences between Jonas and the Giver are clear. They are the same because they can both see color, perform memory transmissions, and understand moods and feelings. Some differences are that the Giver is older, the Giver is more wise, and that the Giver has more power than Jonas.

	One similarity is that they can understand mood, touch, and feelings of each memory which starts in chapter 11. Jonas can feel the cold and the memories just like the Giver. He can understand feelings such as love in chapter 16. Concepts such as hunger can be understood in chapter 14 when the third person states, “But hunger was familiar to him now.  Unconsciously he rubbed his own abdomen, recalling the pain of its unfulfilled needs.” (page 141 hard book)

	The second similarity is that they can both perform memory transmissions. When the Giver first meets Jonas, he gives him a transmission of a memory of snow in chapter 10. Jonas, later gives Gabriel a transmission in chapter 14, “ ... was sliding through his hand into the being of the new child.” Jonas continues to get memories of many things and learns about them. As he learns, he understands the world in the past.

	The third similarity is that they can see color. In chapter 12, Jonas sees the color red. The Giver gives him more memories and gradually sees all colors.  The Giver sighed. “ How to explain this?  Once, back in the time of memories, everything had a shape and size, the way things still do, but they also had a quality called color.” But, the Giver eventually gives all memory of color to Jonas. The Giver becomes color blind and Jonas has most of the memories belong to him.

	Now, the difference between the two is that the Giver looks older and Jonas looks younger. The current Giver says that the memories aged him.  “ I am not, actually, as old as I look,” he told Jonas. “This job has aged me.” The Giver is somewhat young, so he has a good amount of time left before he is release. My prediction is that Jonas will be young, but he might look older in the future.

	Another difference is that the Giver is more wise than Jonas. We can tell this because the Giver is Jonas’s teacher. The Giver helps people with difficulties. He gives memories to Jonas and teaches him about them because the Giver knows a lot about them.

	One more difference is that the Giver has more power as a leader than Jonas. We can tell this because the Giver helps people and he is one of the elders. Jonas still goes to school but has not much authority. Jonas still learns, gets help and is still under control of his parents. Jonas is also under control of the Giver because the Giver trains and instructs him. These differences and similarities are clear in the book which I think are true.",
10/9/2014 20:18:00,"Alexander, Benjamin",The Giver versus Jonas,"		The differences and similarities between Jonas and the Giver are intriguing and deserve further investigation.  Both Jonas and the Giver can receive (pg.76). In addition to this, they both have pale eyes (pg.75). The Giver is old and Jonas is MUCH younger (pg.75). These are some of the many ways Jonas and the Giver are both similar and different.

	Jonas and the Giver share many similarities. Both have the ability to receive, or to transmit, receive and experience memories from the far past (pg.76,77). Pale eyes may be a sign of the ability to receive. Also, obviously, they were both selected to be the Receiver of Memory (pg.60,76). In addition to that, both of them are male (pg.1,75). These are some of the similarities that Jonas and the Giver share.

	Jonas and the Giver differ from each other greatly. The Giver is much older than Jonas (pg.75,). In addition, the Giver has completed his training and, therefore, has many more memories than Jonas (pg.60,77). Obviously, the Giver has more wisdom and experience than Jonas due to the amount of memories he (the Giver) has (pg.77). Also, Jonas tends to be more of a firebrand than the Giver. Jonas reacts to memories passionately but tends to revise these views later. The Giver and Jonas differ in many ways.

	In conclusion, Jonas and the Giver share many similarities but differ form each other in numerous ways. The Giver and Jonas both have pale eyes (pg.75). In addition to this, they also share the ability to receive (pg.76). Although, the Giver does have many more memories than Jonas (pg.76) does. The Giver and Jonas, though sharing many similarities, differ greatly.

10/9/2014 20:19:18,"Geraci, Alicia",The Giver and Jonas,"These are some of the similarities between Jonas and The Giver. The first similarity between Jonas and The Giver is that they both have pale eyes. Another similarity between them is that they both are the Receiver of Memory. Also they both contain memories of stuff, good things and bad things.The Giver and Jonas both were selected not assigned. They both also are very wise. As said in the Ceremony of Twelve The Receiver of Memory must be intelligent, integrity, and courageous so they both are those things ( Chapter 8 page 78 ). Also Jonas and The Giver can both see color. They also both live in the community with there families. Also Jonas and The Giver are kind of like apart from everyone else in the community. They are different compared to everyone else.       
These are some differences between Jonas and The Giver. First The Giver is much older then Jonas. Next, The Giver gives the memories and Jonas receives his memories. Also, Jonas is The Givers well like apprentice I guess you can say. Also The Giver has a daughter named Rosemary ( Chapter 20 Page 203 ). In my opinion i think that Jonas asks more questions than The Giver and has more interests, like he wants to see the world he wants to go to elsewhere. The Giver is wiser than Jonas because he is older and has more experiences.  
The Giver and Jonas have some similarities and differences, but they are both The Receiver of Memory. They are different and the same in many ways. Those are ways The Giver and Jonas are the same and different.",
10/9/2014 20:26:56,"Kaval, Lillian",Jonas and the Giver,"There are many differences between Jonas and the Giver. Also, there are many similarities. After reading this essay, you will know how Jonas and the giver are both alike but also how they differ.
They are different because Jonas is currently training to be the receiver of memory whereas the Giver is the one training him. Also, the Giver is a lot older than Jonas. Another thing is that Jonas doesn't have nearly as many memories as the Giver. The last difference is that Jonas is training a much younger person than the Giver. Those are just some of the many ways that the Giver and Jonas differ.
Although they have many differences, Jonas and the Giver have many similarities as well. One example is that they are both very observant and have pale eyes. Also, they both were chosen to be the receiver of memory and have experienced pain from he past. One other thing is that both the Giver and Jonas have in common is that they are both transmitting memories to someone else. That is how the Giver and Jonas are very similar.
The Giver and Jonas are very similar and very different at the same time. They both are curious, observant and transmit memories to a specific person. On the other hand, Jonas is a lot younger than the Giver, is training Gabriel who is much younger than himself, and the Giver has a lot more memories than Jonas. In conclusion, the Giver and Jonas have many similarities as well as differences. ","Chapters 9,10,13,14, and 15 of the Giver"
10/9/2014 20:27:13,"Hermosilla, Laura",Differences ,"Although sharing some similarities, the differences between the Giver and Jonas are quite noticeable. In the Giver there are two main characters; the Giver and Jonas. In the book the characters spend much time together, because the Giver is Jonas's teacher. Since Jonas was elected to be the new receiver of memory he felt like he did not fit in with his friends. When he went to the Annex room and talked with the Giver he felt comfortable. Even do it seems like they have more similarities they also have quite a lot of differences.
As you might have already concluded the Giver is much older than Jonas, therefore that is just one of the many differences between them. Another difference between the two characters is that the Giver has more experience with memory than Jonas. Jonas lives with his family in their dwelling, but the Giver does not. Since the Giver is older he has a spouse. When Jonas first started ""seeing beyond"" he began to see the color red, but when the Giver first started ""seeing beyond"" he, instead of seeing color, heard music.
 Also they both think in different ways. For example, Jonas says that the Elders are hiding everything from the community and that he should not be the only one who needs to keep the memories. Instead the Giver says that the Elders are trying their best to keep the community safe. As the giver tries to defend the Elders and the community, Jonas criticizes them. Now you can see how the Giver and Jonas are different.

10/9/2014 21:52:32,"Huang, Kelly",Differences and Similarities Between Jonas and The Giver,"     Despite bearing some superficial similarities, the differences between The Giver and Jonas are pronounced. Jonas is a young boy who is somewhat curious. (p. 20) He has been a top student throughout his school days and even committed minor transgressions. (p. 62) Every so often Jonas kept interrupting the Giver because of the nervous tension building up inside him. (p. 77) Jonas came quickly to the conclusion that they should not have to let go of control of many things. (p. 95) His wisdom may come much more quickly than The Giver’s. (p. 95) Not like The Giver, Jonas wanted to decide things not to choose things. (p. 97) Despite bearing some noticeable similarities, the differences between The Giver and Jonas are definite. 
     The differences between The Giver and Jonas are pronounced, and they merit rigorous scrutiny. The Giver is old, but not actually as old as he looks as if he should be scheduled for release very soon; the job aged him. (p. 76) Not just believing that power and honor are not the same, but the Giver knows they are not the same. (p. 84) About ten years ago, he failed his last selection with a girl so his energy is starting to diminish. (p. 76) He needs what strength he had left for Jonas’s training. (p. 76) The Giver’s wisdom came slower than Jonas’s wisdom. (p. 95) When The Giver was hunched over, that is a sign meaning he is in pain. (p. 105/106) The differences between The Giver and Jonas are astonishing, and they deserve accurate surveillance. 
     The similarities between The Giver and Jonas are striking, and they deserve thorough investigation.  Evidently, both of them have pale light eyes which rarely anyone has. (p. 21/75) Jonas and The Giver have the ability that no one else have, and that is to see color. (p. 94) They both are capable of transmitting memories and receiving them too. (p.79/116) Frightened, they were selected at the Ceremony of Twelve. (p. 76) Unlike other people, The Giver and Jonas have the capacity to see beyond. (p. 63/96) The similarities between The Giver and Jonas are eye-catching, and they warrant meticulous examination.

10/9/2014 20:32:56,"Larsen, Emi",Jonas V.S. The Giver,"        The differences between Jonas and the Giver are striking,and they merit rigorous examination. One obvious difference between them is that Jonas is young and the Giver is old(Ch.10 pg.75). This means that the Giver has had a spouse and Jonas hasn't yet (Ch. 13 pg.102).  Then there is the unusual talent  to ""seeing beyond"". The Giver has told Jonas that he had an unusual version of ""seeing beyond"" then him(Ch.12 pg.96). Another difference is that the Giver understands more than Jonas.  They will sometimes argue about decisions that happened long ago(Ch.13 pgs. 97-99). These are reasons how the Giver and Jonas are different.
         The similarities between Jonas and the Giver are pronounced, and they deserve thorough investigation. Jonas and the Giver are like in the fact that they are the only living people that have memories of the past(Ch.10 pg.77) so, they are sometimes asked for council(Ch.13 pg.103 and 111). They have both experienced great pain that no one else has to because they have to keep the memories(Ch.15 pgs.118-120). These are reasons how the Giver and Jonas are similar.
         The similarities and differences between Jonas and the Giver are striking and merit rigorous scrutiny.  The Giver ties the dream of ""the perfect community"" together by with holding the unwanted and terrifying memories of no use(Ch.15 pgs. 118-120). He or she will also hold the warm and happy memories that had become obsolete(Ch.16 pgs.121-125) and gradually people would forget all about life before. When we compare Jonas and the Giver we learn that the society's fate rests upon the shoulders of the Receiver and the Giver at that time. The society would probably fall into ruin that might turn into war.",
10/9/2014 20:33:20,"El-Ali, Matthew",The Giver and Jonas Similarities and Differences,"The similarities between Jonas and the Giver are noticeable, while the differences are striking. The Giver and Jonas are different and similar than each other.  They are both the receiver of memory. But the Giver is old while Jonas is young. Jonas is just starting to train while the Giver is already trained and teaching Jonas all about the past and pain. Although they bear similarities, Jonas and the Giver differences are noticeable. 
	The differences to Jonas and the Giver are very obvious like Jonas and the Giver’s age difference. Jonas receives the memories while the Giver gives Jonas memories of pain like sunburns (pg. 109). Jonas is very mad about Sameness as the Giver does not really care about it (pg. 106). While Jonas takes everything he learns about very surprising, the Giver does not find it surprising (pg. 123). Jonas and the Giver see-beyond in a different way. Jonas and the Giver are very different.  
	Similarities between Jonas and the Giver are harder to notice but there are some similarities. Jonas and the Giver are both capable of enduring the pain from the memories that come with being the receiver of memory. Jonas and the Giver can both see the colors that there is (pg. 122). Both the Giver and Jonas believe that Sameness should be forgotten but really think safety is the key the world’s problems (pg. 108). Jonas and the Giver both are very honorable people when decisions are being made because they make the good decisions. Jonas and the Giver have many different similarities and  differences.

10/9/2014 20:34:42,"Bowers, Abigail",My Giver Essay,"The similarities and differences between Jonas and the Giver are striking, and deserve thorough investigation. For one thing, they both have pale eyes (pg. 75). They both have intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, and the Capacity to See Beyond (pg. 62-63). Both of them experience pain and tire easily (pgs. 106, 108, 109, 118-120). However, with similarities, there must be differences. Jonas has just started his training and still has many things to learn (pg. 63), while the Giver knows lots of things about being a Receiver of Memory.  These are the main similarities and differences between the Giver and Jonas, but we must go into further detail.

The similarities between the Giver and Jonas are striking, and they merit rigorous scrutiny. Both of them can see color (pg. 95). Sometimes, they disagree with and debate about the rules (pg. 95, 97-98). Both of them hold the memories for the citizens of the community so that they do not suffer (pg. the main 103-104). They were both singled out at the Ceremony of the Twelves to be selected (pg. 60). Both are not always confident with themselves. At times, they suffer from the pain and tire from being a Receiver of Memory with the burdens of holding many memories (pgs. 106, 108, 109, 118-120). Those are the similarities between Jonas and the Giver.

Although they bear some similarities, the differences between Jonas and the Giver are salient, and they deserve thorough examination. The Giver may seem old, but he is young (pg. 76). On the other hand, Jonas is obviously young. The Giver wears Elders’ clothes (pg.75), while Jonas wears the regular clothing that Twelves wear. Jonas can only see the color red, but the Giver can see all the colors (pg. 95). The Giver and Jonas have many similarities, but they also have striking differences.

10/9/2014 20:37:42,"Patel, Soham",The Differences Between The Giver and Jonas," Some differences between The Giver and Jonas are here. One of them is that Jonas is a lot younger than the giver (pg.75). The Giver has wrinkles around his eyes (pg.75). Also another difference is that The Giver has sagging flesh (pg. 75). The Giver wants to be called giver instead of receiver of memory (pg.89). 		

Jonas has a very young face. Jonas is also not as old as the giver. Jonas is also the new receiver of memory (pg.76). Jonas is self-conscious about his pale eyes (pg.75).  The Giver must transmit visions to him (pg.79).Jonas cannot transmit visions to anybody like Asher or citizens or even his parents. To transmit memories Jonas has to hold the givers hands. (pg.80).	
						 
The Giver’s attitude to Jonas is indifferent, but he doesn’t really respond well and is somewhat rude towards Jonas. The Giver is very smart, kind, and interesting. The Giver is quiet because he seems stressed. Also The Giver is the only person who can transmit memories. The Giver also seems depressed because of the memories he has. The Giver is not allowed to be released unless he is done teaching the new receiver of memory. The Giver seems almost neutral about teaching Jonas.	
	
Jonas seems scared about being the receiver of memory. But, Jonas’s attitude to The Giver also seems neutral. Jonas’s personality is observant, delightful, and kind. The Giver also has transmitted lots of memories to Jonas and they are simple things people in our world already know.

10/9/2014 20:40:09,"Taggarse, Varadha",Compare/Contrast Jonas and the Giver,"Although they bear some superficial similarities, the differences between Jonas and the Giver are clear. The first important similarity between them is that they both have pale eyes. (pg. 76) When Jonas met the Giver for his first day of training, he realized that the Giver's eyes mirrored his own. We now know that the Giver, Gabriel, and Jonas all have pale eyes. 
Another resemblance between the Giver and Jonas is that they both have the capacity to see beyond. (pg. 92) The Giver can see all of the colors of the daily world. Jonas can only see a glimpse of the colors. For example, Jonas will see the color red for a few seconds and then he will see the color green. The Giver told Jonas that he will be able to see all of the colors one day just like him.
One difference between them is that the Giver has received more memories than Jonas. (pg. 79) Since Jonas has just started his training, the only memory he has gotten is the memory of a sled, snow, sunshine, sunburn, elephants, and breaking a leg. Compared to the Giver, that is nothing. The Giver has experienced memories of the whole world. (pg. 79)  He has felt pain, happiness, and basically all the feelings the memories have given to him. 
The second difference between them is that the Giver is old and Jonas is young. (pg.77) The book describes the Giver as an old man with wrinkles underneath his eyes. Jonas is a young twelve year old boy who is still in training. The Giver has also been the Receiver much longer than Jonas has. The Giver has seen all the actions of the community and how they don’t know much about feelings and color.

10/9/2014 20:50:07,"Haymore, Caleb",Compare and Contrast,"      My first similarity between the Giver and Jonas is that they can both ""see beyond."" This characteristic is what makes you be able to receive and give memories. Also, a side effect is they pale eyes, which they also both have.Gabriel has it to, because Jonas was able to transmit a memory to him (page#116).

      My second reason is that both Jonas and the Giver are brave. In the Ceremony of  Twelve, the Chief Elder told Jonas he must have courage  (Pg #62). The Giver was probably told that when he was selected, and now they see why. Now Jonas has received memories of pain, he understands why he has to be brave to endure those memories.

      My last similarity is that they both can see color. Before Jonas was selected, he would see things change, though he didn't know how (Pg # 24). The Chief Elder called it ""seeing beyond""(Pg#63), and when Jonas started receiving memories he started to see more colors. He began to see them in his everyday life, and learned to recognize them(Pg#97). The Giver had said he already could see all the colors through the memories(Pg#95). ",
10/9/2014 21:01:53,"Xiang, Ray",Jonas and the Giver,"     While some differences between the Giver and Jonas are noticeable, the similarities are striking. A difference would be that Jonas, the main character, has the Capacity to See Beyond, but the Giver has the Capacity to Hear beyond (p. 63 & 157). In other words, Jonas has the ability to see color, but the Giver has the ability to hear music (p. 63 & 157). Another way they contrast is that the Giver looks very old, and Jonas is still a teenager (p. 73). By “looks very old” I mean that literally because he once quoted that he looks older than he actually is (p. 74). Lastly, the Giver seems to know a lot more. For example, the Giver talked about a sled, downhill, and snow, but Jonas did not understand those words at all.

     Jonas and the Giver have many characteristics in common such as the fact that both of them were affected when memories were transferred to them (p. 109 & 118). For instance, Jonas twisted his leg in a memory and his leg still hurt afterward, of the Giver was tortured by a memory of warfare(p. 109 & 118). Also, Jonas and the Giver can transfer memories to others (p.80 & 116). Another way that they are similar is that they both have pale eyes (p. 20 & 61). Finally, they both can use their memories to give advice to others (p. 111-112 & p.134).

     There are three similarities between the Giver and Jonas that in my opinion are the most remarkable. First, the Giver and Jonas both have jumped to conclusions many times right after they receive a memory (p. 95). Second, they both cannot explain why love can be dangerous (p. 126). Last, as stated, they can both transfer memories to others (p.80 & 116).

Jonas is 12 and the giver is receiving his memories. Another thing is once you turn 12 you also can see red. The ceremony of 10 is when you get your first haircut. Jonas sister Lily is eight years old. Jonas is having bad dreams and one of his dreams is when he was sliding down the hill he falls off, and his face falls off. Gabriel is a baby that has the same eyes as Jonas and Jonas's family is raising him. A weird fact in the giver is you only see Black and white and tell you hit a certain age.
Everybody in the giver is literally adopted nobody has their real birth mother. Birth mother in the giver is a job. Jonas's mother and father are thinking of ways to help Gabriel, he is not sleeping well at night. They try fixing the problem by putting Gabriel's crib and Jonas's room. The giver told Jonas a secret that he was supposed to not know and he is trying to keep it a secret.
When Jonas  was given his assessment he was given rules. A question  everybody wants to know is (does Gabriel die). The giver is a really weird society it has really weird jobs like birth other you have a baby then give it away. Also the only Color you can see at first is black and white. Those are my three parographs on the giver. On last thing Mr. Urista is boss

10/9/2014 21:20:47,"Thomas, Casey",Jonas vs. The Giver,"     In the book there are two main characters Jonas and the giver. The Giver is teaching Jonas how to do his job. While some differences between Jonas and The Giver are evident, the similarities are striking.
     Jonas and The Giver are different in many ways. Jonas is a twelve year old boy who goes to school. He has been selected for his new assignment as receiver. Jonas has experienced almost no pain and is looking for new experiences. The Giver is an elder in the community who advises the council of elders. He needs to teach his profession to Jonas the new receiver. The differences between the two characters are obvious. One is old and teaching the other is young and learning.
     Given the circumstances the similarities between Jonas and The Giver are surprising. Jonas and The Giver are the only two people in the community that experience the memories of the past. Since that is the case they are the only ones able to feel emotion like pain, love, and hate. Jonas and The Giver both think war is terrible.  They both think love is a wonderful thing that nobody understands. They both think that the society should change so the people can make their own decisions  They both have a similar outlook on the world.
     In conclusion, even though there age and rolls are very different the memories that they share bring them close together. The differences they have the more connected they become. Both characters understand the importance of love, hate, pain, and fear.

10/9/2014 21:32:18,"Harris, Zachary",The Giver vs Jonas,"There are many similarities and differences between jonas and the Giver. A few similarities is that they both have grey eyes(p.75-76)and they both have supernatural powers(p.). A difference is that they have different personaleties(p.  ). For instance the giver can get very grumpy at times and be in pain. 
Jonas and the Giver were similar with the fact that they were both given supernatural powers. These powers were helpful in advising the council of elders. They provided a history of  the world in experience and knowledge. For example, when people in society wanted more children, The Giver told them that in the past, when the  population increased, starvation occurred. 

Jonas was different from The Giver in that he was outgoing and courageous. He took a baby over the mountains and deserts to take him to safety. The Giver never admitted that he was too afraid of being released to do the same act. But once he had Jonas he could. Jonas was outgoing and tried to tell his friends and family about the color and sound. The Giver was quiet and told no one of his powers. 

The Giver and jonas are very similar and different. This shows in many ways. These are a few of them. In the book ""The Giver"" these two people are different from most people of the community. This makes them both impacting people.

10/9/2014 21:37:27,"Verdugo, Kalei",Jonas vs. The Giver,"     The Giver and Jonas are similar in several ways. They both have pale eyes, which gives them depth. (pg. 21, 61) Also, they both have been ""selected"" to be the Receiver of Memory. (pg. 60) Jonas and the Giver can both express their feelings.

     The Giver and Jonas are also different in some ways. The Giver is much older than Jonas. (pg. 75) Jonas has just became a Twelve. (pg. 59) The Giver also has more wisdom from the memories than Jonas does. Jonas has very few memories compared to the Giver.

     Jonas wants to make certain changes to the community. He wants to let people make more of their own choices, and not have the Elders decide for them. He also wants to let the citizens see in color. Finally, Jonas wants to give the memories back to all of the citizens, but the Giver said that it would create chaos. (pg. 98)","The Giver, published by Laurel-Leaf in 2002"
10/9/2014 21:41:28,"Everette, Gianna",Differences,"     There are many differences between Jonas and The Giver, but there are also many similarities about them. They are similar because they both have pale eyes and they are both Receivers of Memory. They are different because The Giver is ""weighed down"" with many memories of the past while Jonas is still learning about the memories of the past and is trying to figure out what type of pain that will be involved with the memories. The Giver has obtained wisdom of the past and will help the people of the community in a time of need or when there is a new idea to the community while Jonas is still an adult-in-training and will obtain his wisdom very soon.

     The Giver is actually quite different from Jonas. First of all, The Giver can Hear Beyond while Jonas can only See Beyond. Also, The Giver knows the true meaning of release while Jonas thinks that you are being released to Elsewhere. The Giver is quite old and tired and is losing strength, but Jonas is still new to the concept of receiving memories so he helps Jonas on his path to obtain wisdom.

Jonas is quite new to receiving memories of the past from The Giver and is unsure about what he is going to expect. He is frightened about the pain part of his training, but finds the happy ones introducing him to new concepts, methods and feelings which makes him see his world with a different interpretation. Although Jonas is much younger than The Giver, The Giver believes that Jonas will obtain his wisdom much faster than Jonas. Also, Jonas sadly realizes that he took the colors away from The Giver because The Giver can now only Hear Beyond. He realizes that The Giver is having trouble keeping the colors within his grasp.","Chapter 8 page 61

10/9/2014 21:47:18,"Wiberg, Vance",My 10/10 Giver essay,"	As a result of The Giver's and Jonas’s levels of knowledge, they differ in daily life, mindset, and personality. In The Giver by Lois Lowry the daily life of Jonas and The Giver are very different.  Firstly The Giver lives alone in the annex room, but Jonas lives with his family.  Jonas, like any Twelve in his community, goes to school, while The Giver chooses to sit, thinking about his memories, alone.  Jonas has other friends who are Twelves. However, The Giver, an old man, is totally alone.  The Giver is the only one in the community that is authorized to own books other than the required household books that everyone is allowed.  When Jonas shows up to his first day as the Receiver of Memory, Lowry says, “In his own dwelling, there were the necessary reference volumes that each household contained . . . but this room’s walls were completely covered by bookcases” (Page 74). These are some of the many differences in The Giver’s and Jonas’s daily life.
	The Giver and Jonas have very different mindsets. The mindset of The Giver is hard to determine because we are not in his head, but we can tell some of it from what he says.  The Giver would love to give advice to the Elders, but they rarely ask for it.  The Giver is very specific about how having honor is not the same as having power. Jonas thinks that if The Giver recommends changes the elders would listen.  When talking about seeing beyond The Giver comments on his experiences by saying, “I began to experience it, though it took a different form” (Page 92).  This shows that the had a different development of his seeing beyond because his mind works differently.  These examples show how polarized the minds of The Giver and Jonas are.
	Also, there are many differences in The Giver’s and Jonas’s personalities. The first major difference is the fact that  The Giver is much more mysterious and often keeps things from Jonas.  When Jonas was asking The Giver about his “seeing beyond,”  The Giver says, “‘Another day,” . . . “I will tell you another day”(Page 96).  Jonas is very curious about the past and wants to experience as many feelings as he can. Jonas is very hopeful for the community and wants to change it in way like giving its color back.  However, The Giver does not care for the community and just does his job. These are the main distinctions between Jonas and The Giver.

10/9/2014 21:50:54,"Grabill, Zachary",Jonas vs. the Giver,"     Although they bear some minor differences, the similarities between the Giver and Jonas are very pronounced. For one thing, they can both see colors. Also, they both have pale eyes. The Giver and Jonas both have the capacity to see beyond, and all the necessary qualities needed to be a receiver of memory, but the Giver has more memories than Jonas, which means he has more wisdom.
     The Giver and Jonas also have some minor differences. The Giver is old, whereas Jonas is young. Jonas does not have a spouse, but the Giver does. the Giver, unlike Jonas, is on the Committee of Elders. Also, the Giver possesses a lot of memories, but Jonas only has a few, but the Giver is giving away his memories to Jonas, so this won't be true for long.
     The two also have a lot in common, like the fact that they are both male Receivers of Memory who have the capacity to see beyond, which means they can see colors. They are the only ones who know what real pain is. Another similarity is that they both have pale eyes, a trait that might have something to do with seeing beyond. Both of them live in a dystopian community where choices are made for you and you can't see color, thanks to genetic engineering. The Giver and Jonas can both receive memories and transmit memories to others who have the capacity to see beyond. Also, they both want to change the unfair way their community treats them. The community forces them both to bear all of the horrible, painful, and bad memories of the past.
     These are just some of the differences and similarities between Jonas and the Giver.

10/9/2014 22:12:03,"Kim, Taewoo (Shawn)",Comparing and Contrasting,"  This writing prompt is about comparing and contrasting between The Giver and Jonas. There are many similarities and differences between the two. The similarities between Jonas and The Giver are evident and they deserve examination.
  One similarity between Jonas and The Giver is their eye color. Both Jonas and The Giver have pale eyes which is uncommon in the community. “Jonas looked self-consciously into the pale eyes of the old man that mirrored his own.”(pg. 95). In addition, both also have or will be through a lot of painful memories which gave or will give them wisdom. “‘I used my wisdom, from the memories,’ The Giver said. Jonas realized something. ‘That means,’ he said slowly, ‘that you have memories of pain. And you have to give them to me, too, because I have to get wisdom.’”(pg. 142). To add on, The Giver mentions that he had felt the same way about being selected as Jonas. “The man closed his eyes and continued speaking. ‘When I became a Twelve, I was selected, as you were. I was frightened, as I’m sure you are.’ He opened his eyes for a moment and peered at Jonas, who nodded.”
  Although they have some similarities, the differences between The Giver and Jonas are clear. For instance there is an age contrast. The Giver is much older than Jonas. “‘I can see that you are very old,’ Jonas responded with respect.”(pg. 96) Another difference is the “seeing-beyond”. While it is true that both Jonas and the Receiver experienced the “seeing-beyond”, the Receiver experienced it differently. “‘Giver,’ Jonas asked as he arranged himself again on the bed, ‘how did it happen to you when you were becoming The Receiver? You said that the seeing-beyond happened to you, but not the same way.’”

10/9/2014 22:14:40,"Zhang, April",The Differences Between Jonas and the Current Giver," The differences between the current Giver and Jonas are very pronounced and they deserve a thorough investigation. The obvious differences includes their age(p. 61), their personalities (p. 93), and their life experiences. The current Giver gives  memories and Jonas receives them. The current Giver is more knowledgeable than Jonas.
     The current Giver and Jonas are from different generations. The psychological ages between the current Giver and Jonas are also divergent. The Giver expressed, ""This job has aged me"" (p. 76). Their personalities are also distinct in that Jonas takes less time to think while it takes the current Giver longer time to ponder. 
     Although they bear many differences, there are many striking similarities between them as well. For example, they both have pale eyes which give them a certain look of depth (p.61). Both of them are honest, intelligent, and courageous (p.62-63). They both have the capacity to see beyond.
         Jonas's mission in his life is to receive all the memories from the current Giver and to fulfill his roll as the Giver when he  becomes of age. Jonas received many memories of warfare, hunger, snow, sails on a bright blue day, love, warmth, and family. He learned many new words such as sunshine, sun, sunburn, snow, runners, and hills. Jonas felt surprised and was eager to receive whatever experience would come next. While the Giver's mission in life is to give Jonas memories of Elsewhere so that he can advise the Council of Elders in their time of needs. The Giver is happy to have the weight of the memories to be taken from him, and for Jonas, he's happy when the memories are about good experiences and he is sad when the memories cause pain.

They both can transmit and have knowledge of memories that no one else knows(pg. 80 and 116).  The Giver has pale blue eyes like those that Jonas has(pg. 75).  Both of their instructions say that they can lie and ask rude questions(pg. 68).

	The Giver is obviously a lot older than Jonas(pg. 75 and 76).  He also has many days were he is in great pain because of painful memories(1 Ex: is pg. 119).  Jonas has not yet and probably will not feel those pains for a long time.  Unlike Jonas the Giver obeys his instructions every day.  Jonas does not obey his instructions because he transmits memories to Gabriel every night so that he will fall asleep( pg. 129). He is not suppose to give information of what he knows to anyone in the community except for the next person that is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory.  
	The Giver and Jonas both bear similarities and differences. They both have the great qualities of being the Receiver of Memory.  Both of them have pale eyes.

10/9/2014 22:25:12,"Jungerman-Duarte, Mia",The Giver and Jonas,"The Giver and Jonas have a few differences. For example, one is older than the other or on has more memories than the others. Although they bear some minor differences the similarities between the giver and Jonas are remarkable. For example, they both have pale eye in which they can see color because of it. Another similarity is that they both can transmit and receive memories. This helps them so that they have memories to pass on.
	 They are alike because they both are capable to see beyond. This means they cans see more than what regular people see. They are also because they know everything that other people do not know. For example, snow, rain, or anything weather like. Other examples are warfare or their surroundings. 
	A few differences are they both have different opinions. They also both have different feelings. Most importantly they have different memories. For example, have memories, but once the Giver gives them to Jonas he does not have them anymore.  Another thing is that Jonas has more energy than the Giver. 
	More similarities and differences are the both have the same characteristics. This means that they think the same in a certain way. Jonas also has less experience than the Giver. This is because he is barely starting. 
For comparing them it mainly comes down to how they look alike or how they think the same. For contrasting it comes down to who knows more or who has more energy. There are a lot of similarities and differences. Now you know more about the Giver and Jonas.

10/9/2014 22:34:56,"Huang, Konnie",Jonas vs. The Giver,"     While some differences between The Giver and Jonas are evident, the similarities are pronounced. When Jonas received the instructions for his assignment, the rule exempting rudeness startled him since Jonas would never thought of taking advantage of it by asking people uncomfortable questions. (p. 69) Jonas felt nervous whenever he interrupted The Giver and as he apologized, The Giver stated that there should not be apologizes. (p. 77) Each time as he slept, Jonas would picture himself sliding down the hill reaching for a goal, but he could not quite grasp that something. (p. 88) Saying it as fiercely and indulgent, Jonas came to a conclusion that the ways things are now, should not have happened. (p. 95) While Jonas’s groupmates have become satisfied with their lives, Jonas often became angry at them for not knowing what he has to take on for his Assignment. (p. 99) Jonas would try to be brave after going through the pain he experienced downhill, and remembering that the Chief Elder had once said he was brave. (p. 110) Thus, the differences between The Giver and Jonas are noticeable, but the similarities are salient. 

     Despite bearing some superficial similarities, the differences between The Giver and Jonas are remarkable. The Giver, an Elder, is the current Receiver of Memory for a very, very, long time. (p. 75) Feeling his energy diminishing, The Giver failed his last selection ten years ago, and he needs the last bit of his strength to train Jonas. (p. 76) His job is to not only transmit memories, but memories of the whole world and generations way back. (p. 77) When Jonas said he was brave and could handle the pain, The Giver smiled, believing wholeheartedly that Jonas was truly brave. (p. 85) As a result, despite bearing some minor similarities, the differences between The Giver and Jonas are pronounced. 

     The similarities between Jonas and The Giver are striking and they merit thorough investigation. Both Jonas and The Giver have pale eyes which gave them a look that Jonas described as “depth”. (p. 20/21) Jonas and The Giver have something special about them that no one else has which was the Capacity to See Beyond,  meaning they can see color. (p. 63/94) They both wished for them to have those things such as snow and the rest of it. (p. 84) The Giver and Jonas were frightened when they were selected to be the next Receiver of Memory.

10/9/2014 22:37:39,"Vasudeo, Siddharth",Jonas vs. The Giver,"     Jonas and The Giver are two very different people.  Their differences have to do with age, experience and their roles in society.  Jonas is a young, 12 year old boy who is selected to be the received of memories.  The Giver, on the other hand, is an old man who transmits these memories to Jonas.  In this essay, I shall compare and contrast their differences.
     The Giver is old and very wise.  He has gained wisdom through the memories of experiences, both his and those of people of the past.  In Chapter 10, page 78, The Giver says to Jonas, ""There's all that goes beyond-all that is Elsewhere-and all that goes back and back and back.  I received all of those when I was selected.  And here in this room all alone I re-experience them again and again.  This is how wisdom comes. And how we shape our future.""  On the contrary, Jonas is young and inexperienced and thus has no wisdom from people of the past.  As a result, Jonas and The Giver have very different roles in society.  The Giver has a position of honor and respect and is approached by others for advice.  But when Jonas tries to share information with others, they do not believe him.
     Another main difference is that The Giver sees all colors however Jonas sees the world only in black and white.  If the colors can be thought of as knowledge through memories, The Giver sees all colors because he has gained lots of knowledge through the memories he has acquired.  Jonas wants to see in color, in Chapter 13, page 97, Jonas says to The Giver, ""But I want them!...It isn't fair that nothing has color!""  As memories get transferred from The Giver to Jonas, he begins to see the color red, in flashes.  He also starts to dream in color which means he starts to dream about the memories or experiences that he has received.  He likes the good memories and does not like the memories of pain.  These weigh him down for the rest of the day.      
       In a way, the relationship between Jonas and The Giver is like that of a student and a teacher or a parent and a child.  The older, experienced one shares the knowledge that they have gained through experience with the younger one.  Just as The Giver was a receiver, the teacher was also a student at an earlier time.  ",
10/9/2014 22:47:05,"Kimball, Brooke",The Giver vs. Jonas,"     While some differences between the Giver and Jonas are obvious, the similarities are remarkable.    The Giver and Jonas can both see beyond, which is an instrumental trait throughout the book.  While they can see beyond their level of experience is very different.   Following are some examples of how these two characters resemble and contrast each other. 
     Jonas and the Giver are similar because they both are men. (pg-1 & 61).  Another resemblance between them is they both have pale eyes. (pg-20).  One of the main similarities the Giver and Jonas have in common is that they can see beyond. (pg - 63).  This is very important in the Giver because no citizen has feelings or and they can’t see color.  The fact that the Giver and Jonas can see beyond helps the society by providing memories that give very important information about uncommon occurrences in the society.  The last comparison between the Giver and Jonas is their feelings. (pg. -126).  They both have very strong feelings and expressions about all memories 
     Not only do the Giver and Jonas have similarities but they also have many differences between them. A  One of the key differences between them is experience. (pg – 112).  They are very different in experience because the Giver can see all colors, has been exposed to all the memories, and has more feelings than Jonas.  Jonas has to ask why everything in the community is the way that it is, whereas the Giver accepts it as is. (pg – 111).  A very important aspect of the Giver is how much pain he goes through each day and throughout the past years. (pg – 118).
     Although they bear some differences, the similarities between the Giver and Jonas are evident.  The fact that they are both males, can see beyond and have strong feelings about their memories are great examples of their similarities.  Although their differences are not as prevalent they still exist.  The fact that they have very diverse levels of experience and that they accept what happens in their society very differently are just a few examples.   All of these comparisons and contrasts make the book very fascinating and make you want to keep turning the page.

They also agreed that if they changed the rules it would be more dangerous (Chapter 13 pg.123). The Giver and Jonas liked to be with others such as their friends and families. (Chapter 13 pg.131)
	What they did not have in common was that Jonas was more curious, worried, and more happy. Jonas also expressed his feelings more than the Giver.(Chapter 13 pg.122) The Giver was different from Jonas because he was wiser, more calm, smarter, and more experienced.(Chapter 14 pg.142)  Those were some of the reasons why Jonas and the Giver were different from each other. Also, Jonas was younger and could be a better Receiver than Giver.
	One of the impacts on Jonas was that he had pale eyes. Having pale eyes could make him see color. (Chapter 3 pg.25) Another impact on Jonas was that he was selected as the Receiver of Memory, and the affect was that he didn't have time to have fun and share dreams. (Chapter 8 pg.75-81) Jonas had to follow the eight rules. If someone found out that he didn't follow those rules, Jonas would be automatically punished. (Chapter 9 pg.86-87) 
	The first impact on Giver was that he had pale eyes like Jonas which made him see color too. (Chapter 12 pg.115-121) The second impact on Giver was that his job was to train Jonas, so Jonas could be a trained Receiver. Another impact was that the Giver had to explain a lot of things, gave him memories, and answered every question that Jonas had. (Chapter 10 pg. 95-96) The final impact was that Giver had all the memories which people called him ""wise.""( Chapter 14 pg.141-142)

One difference betwwen Jonas and the curent Reciever is that the Reciever has alot more memories of the past than Jonas. Another difference is that the curent Reciever is alot older than Jonas by alot. Also Jonas still has to go to school in the mornings before going to traing unlike the curent Reciever. Those are just a few differences between Jonas and the current Reciever.

10/9/2014 23:57:39,"Nguyen, Lydia",Jonas and the Giver,"There are many reasons why they are similar. One reason is that they both have pale eyes unlike the rest of the community. (pg. 61) They were also selected to become the next Receiver when they were Twelves. (pg. 76)  The Giver went through the same painful training that Jonas is destined to go through. (pg 76) Then again, they both share the same burden of not being able to share the knowledge that they both know and have in common. (pg. 68, pg. 76, pg. 102) Those are a few reasons why Jonas and the Giver are similar.
Although there are many similarities between Jonas and the Giver, there are many other differences that they share too. As a child, the Giver heard beyond (music). (pg.  The Giver carries a huge burden of memories. He isn’t as old as he looks but the reason why he looks so old is because of the effects of keeping painful memories. (pg. 75-56)  After much time of being the Receiver, the Giver became a lonely man who developed much patience and silence. In conclusion, the Giver is incredibly different compared to Jonas.
On the other hand, Jonas is unlike the Giver in many ways too. Since Jonas recently became a Receiver (in training), it shows that he doesn’t have as much experience as the Giver. (pg. 72 to the end of the book basically) Which resulted in him not having many memories that wear and weigh him down tremendously.   He also is more serious and observant than his peers. He is very intelligent and determined with a fresh, young mind. That is why Jonas is dissimilar to the Giver. (I basically inferred his personality from clues in the book.)

10/10/2014 1:26:56,"Soto Jr., Joseantonio",Jonas and The Giver,"Jonas and the Giver live in a world with difficult rules which are made to make their world very safe and comfortable.   Jonas appears to be like any other eleven-year-old boy living in his community. He seems smarter and more sensitive than the other children his own age and he acts more serious than they do about life. He worries about his own future as well as his friend Asher’s.  Jonas has the ability to see things change in a way that he cannot explain and he hides this ability.  Jonas becomes extremely sensitive to things such as beauty, love, and suffering.  He becomes more loving toward his family and the Giver, and very passionate about his new beliefs and feelings. He needs the guidance and wisdom of the Giver to help him understand all of his new experiences.
The Giver is a patient and wise elder and he becomes Jonas’ teacher and mentor.  He is very wise and has life experience as well as memories that he shares with Jonas.   He helps Jonas realize that all the things that he and the rest of the community think are great are really bad.  Jonas, in a way, represents the Giver in his youth.  Jonas is the way the Giver can change things and to make things right in the community.  
To start this change, the Giver helps Jonas understand the importance of love.  Jonas says to the Giver, “And that I wish we could be that way, and that you could be my grandparent.”   Jonas goes on to confess to the Giver “I liked the felling of love,” and “I wish we still had that.”  Jonas goes on to ask his father if he loves him. His father says to Jonas “Precision of language, please!”
I think that Jonas and the Giver are very similar and that the Giver sees Jonas as a younger version of himself.  Through Jonas the Giver can finally overcome his failure and realize his goal to change the community, and bring love back into their world.

10/10/2014 6:32:21,"Cohen, Mallorie",Jonas and the Giver,"     Despite bearing some minor similarities, the differences between Jonas and the Giver are pronounced. Jonas and the Giver may have both been selected as the Receiver of Memory, but are two very different people with two very different personalities (Giver chapter 8, pg.60). For example, in the book the Giver is a lot of times to worn down to train Jonas that day, so Jonas is sometimes sent home with no new memories (Giver chapter 13 pg. 105), while Jonas is a high energy person who is always thirsting for the knowledge from the Giver or any source possible (Giver chapters 10-23). Jonas and the Giver may have some similarities, but are quite different.

         Jonas is a fun, energetic person who loves to accumulate knowledge. He is very curious when it comes to his training, like when he asked why the memories of the past were taken from the community and given to the Giver to suffer (Giver chapter 14, pg.113). Jonas is also interested in pleasing everyone. He is always trying to do the best he can to make it right in every situation no matter the person it is for or what the deed is to be done (Giver chapter 14, pg.113). Jonas also can be careless at times like when he gave Gabriel the memory of the boat ride (Giver chapter 14, pg.116). 

     The Giver is a serious man, who has suffered a great deal of pain for many years (Giver chapter 13, pg.105). He spends his days reading or when he is lucky, the Council of Elders will call upon him for guidance (Giver chapter 14 pg.111-112). This man is also very wise therefore can assist when called upon even in everyday life. The Giver is an honored, respectable man who is considered to have the most important role in the entire community (Giver chapter 13 pg.105).

     The Giver and Jonas, as you can see, do have some similarities, but their differences are what are the most noticeable.

10/10/2014 6:57:22,"Hayatt, Hannah",Jonas and the Giver; Different of the same?,"While Jonas and the Giver have minor differences, the similarities between them are remarkable. Jonas has a family unit, while the Giver does but is separated from his. The Giver is old, and has many pieces of wisdom to share. Jonas, however, is young and is taking the wisdom and learning from the Giver. 

The Giver and Jonas have many more similarities. they both are recievers of memory-the Giver used to be. they both must share the qualities that the  Elder spoke of at the ceremony of twelve. They must have recieved a document telling them about their assignments. Those were only a few of the similarities.

The Giver and Jonas, while quite different, really feel-to the reader-that Jonas is practically a clone of the Giver.",
10/15/2014 7:45:27,"Lawson, Lauren",Jonas and The Giver,"The diffrences between Jonas and The Giver are very clear, but the similarities are pronounced. One diffrences between The Giver and Jonas is the Giver is much more developed as a Giver, while Jonas has just started learning. Another difference between them is Jonas is still getting used to breaking the previous rules he once new and  learning the new. Also Jonas is a reicever and The Giver is a Giver.
    The  similarities between Jonas and the Giver are endless! One is both of them can see beyond. Both of them will and are passing down memories. They are aloud to lie. Both of them used to be normal in the community.
     Here are some similaraties and diffrences. The giver started seeing color before him, but they both see color. The giver has seen all of the memories, but Jonas has the ability to see all of them. In conclusion Jonas and the giver have a lot of similaraties and diffrences. ",
10/19/2014 16:43:29,"Fisher, Jordan",The Giver: A Comparison of Jonas and The Giver,"In the book, The Giver, the main characters Jonas and the Giver bear noticeable and obvious differences. However, they also share many remarkable similarities. 
The most obvious difference between Jonas and the Giver is their age. In the book it is evident that Jonas is now a ""twelve."" He is a young boy. The Giver is described as ""wrinkled"" and as having ""tired eyes."" Jonas says, ""I can see that you are very old"" (pg. 75). The Giver is also described as having ""sagging flesh."" Although the Giver is not as old as he looks, there is a clear difference in the years the two characters have lived.  These years of life make lead to another noticeable difference in the two characters; their experience. The Giver holds a lifelong time of memories so he has much more experience than Jonas. Two examples of his experiences that he shares with Jonas are pain and hunger. The Giver gives Jonas the memory of breaking his leg on a sled. In the book, Jonas describes it as if “a hatchet lay lodged in his leg slicing through each nerve” (pg. 109). Jonas discovered the experience of pain for the first time. The Giver also shares the excruciating feeling of neglect and being unfed. On page 110 Jonas describes this feeling as causing “excruciating spasms in his empty, distended stomach.” While lying on the bed in pain he questions the Giver and asks “Why do you and I have to hold these memories” (pg. 111)? The Giver replies, “It gives us wisdom.” These examples help illustrate the life experience the Giver has in comparison to Jonas.
Although the Giver and Jonas are different in ways, they share many qualities. Two obvious similarities are the light color of their eyes and abilities to “see beyond.” But, I think the facts that they both have feelings and are brave are more significant similarities. In the book it states that Jonas and the Giver both like the feeling of love. The Giver gives Jonas a memory filled with warmth, family, and happiness. On page 125, Jonas says, “I certainly liked the memory though I couldn’t quite get the word for the whole feeling of it.” Jonas likes this memory and knows what a grandparent is. Soon after his training with the Giver he becomes sensitive to beauty, pleasure, and suffering. The giver also understands feelings and has kindness in his heart. Another important similarity is that they are both brave. When Jonas runs away the Giver knows he will suffer when Jonas’s memories are released to the community. Jonas risks death by leaving. They are both willing to take chances and suffer for others. They are both very brave. Their ability to feel and love makes them see their community as unjust. Jonas states that “it isn’t fair that nothing has color” (pg. 97). 
These two characters have many differences and similarities. Some of these differences and similarities are obvious while others involve my ideas of the book. Jonas and the Giver are share qualities that make them unique people in their community.

10/24/2014 19:50:56,"Dal Ponte, Hannah",Jonas and the Giver,"        There are many similarities and differences between Jonas and the Giver.  The community chose both of them to be the Giver (pg. 60), but now it is Jonas's turn to hold all the memories, good and bad.  Holding the memories for so long, the Giver has become old and tired.   In comparison, Jonas is energetic and curious.  Jonas wants to talk about his job with his friends and family, but he knows he and the Giver cannot (pg. 99).  Being the Giver is a significant responsibility as one can see.
	The distinctions between Jonas and the Giver are further reflected in their everyday lives.  The old Receiver of Memory has no family.  His room is his life.  Here he keeps his books and stays every day.  He did have a wife, but she now lives with the Childless Adults (pg. 102).  Jonas, on the other hand, has a family unit and lots of friends.  In addition, the Giver can also see in full color, unlike Jonas who is just starting to see the color red (pg. 94).  For Jonas ""seeing beyond"" began with the apple, then the people's faces at the ceremony of 12, and lastly with Fiona's hair. 
	The Giver holds within him all the memories of the past.  Holding the pain of bad memories from the past allows the people of the community to not suffer.   Jonas thought that after receiving the recollection of snow that everything was going to be enjoyable to receive (pg. 81).  But then the Giver showed him a elephant dying and a gun (pg. 100).  Now Jonas knows how brave the old Giver must be to hold all the bad memories.","the Giver

10/25/2014 15:40:22,"Haymore, Caleb",Compare and Contrast,"My first difference between the Giver and Jonas is that Jonas can ""see beyond""(Pg. 63), and the Giver can ""hear beyond"". For Jonas, this means that he can see flashes of the color red, before he starts receiving memories, and getting all the colors. He would see things change, like an apple, or  Fiona's red hair. For the Giver, the book didn't really say, but one could guess that it was he could hear certain sounds before receiving memories and hearing them all. Now you know a difference between Jonas and the Giver.

My second similarity is that both Jonas and the Giver are brave. In the Ceremony of Twelve, the Chief Elder told Jonas he had to have courage(Pg. 62). Jonas didn't see why at the time, but now he has received memories of loss and pain, he knows. When the Giver was a Twelve, and was picked to be the Receiver of Memory, he probably told the same thing. The Giver endured the receiving of memories and was brave, otherwise he wouldn't be teaching Jonas, and now Jonas is also being brave. Now you can see that both Jonas and the Giver were brave.

My last similarity is they can both Receive memories. This is one of the characteristics that Receivers of Memory have to have. It means that you can Receive, experience, and recall memories given to you. A side affect is the fact that you have pale eyes. In the book, it says Gabriel has pale eyes, which means he could be a Receiver too(Pg. 20. This is my last similarity between the Giver and Jonas.
