  text:'The Giver and Jonas are similar in many ways. One similarity that they both share is their pale eyes (pgs. 20 & 61). Everyone else in the community has dark eyes, with the exception of a few (pg. 20). This is a symbol that they both have the ability to “see-beyond” (pg. 63). Another similarity the Giver and Jonas share is the honor and separation from the community. When Jonas is selected to become the Receiver of Memory, he immediately senses that he is different from the rest of the community, and this puts him at unease (pg. 65). Since the Giver is also the Receiver of Memory, he also is different and separate from the community, though he is more used to this. These were some similarities between Jonas and the Giver.Jonas and the Giver are also different in a number of ways. One difference they both have is their reaction to being separate from the community. The Giver is used to this, since he had much more training than Jonas, and does not seem bothered by it (pgs. 103 & 104). On the other hand, Jonas is nervous, because throughout his whole life he has learned that differences were considered to be wrong (pgs. 38 & 65). A second difference between the Giver and Jonas is that they both experienced the “Capacity to See Beyond” but in different ways (pg. 92). When Jonas got his first signs of the Capacity to See Beyond, what he saw was the color red (pg. 94). The Giver, however, explains that his seeing-beyond happened to him in a different way, which he will tell Jonas what it exactly is later (pg. 96). These were some differences between Jonas and the Giver.Though the Giver and Jonas are different in many ways, they are also similar in many ways as well. Jonas and the Giver share physical similarities, and emotional similarities as well. Both have pale eyes, which means they can both see beyond (pg. 20 & 61). The Giver and Jonas are physically separate from the community because they train alone with only each other, and they are not allowed to share it with anybody (pgs. 61 & 68). They are emotionally separate from the community because, since they are not allowed to share their training with anybody, only they know the true pleasures and pains of life and that the world was different “back and back and back” (pgs. 94 – 107). Of course, the Giver and Jonas are different in many ways as well. For example, they “see-beyond” for the first time differently (pg. 92). “Seeing-beyond” for Jonas first happens when he sees a flash of red in an apple, which slowly begins to occur in other objects, such as the audience at the annual Ceremony and Fiona’s hair (pg. 94). However, later in the book, the Giver explains to Jonas that he “hears-beyond” for the first time, and when Jonas asks him what he hears, he says he hears music (pg. 157). In conclusion, the Giver and Jonas share many similarities and differences.',

  text:"There are many differences between Jonas and the current Giver. The first thing is that, the current Giver is more experienced than Jonas. First, The Giver has received more memories than him; also The Giver was in this position and job much longer than Jonas. In chapter 10, the Giver even says, “I have been the Receiver for a long time. A very, very long time.”  The Giver knows many more memories, than Jonas. So far Jonas has had only like 3 memories sunburn, snow, and sunshine. Obviously, if the Giver wasn’t more experienced than Jonas, how could he transmit memory, for example snow, to Jonas when Jonas doesn’t even know what that is? \nAnother difference about the current Receiver and the current Giver is their age difference. Jonas is a twelve, and the Giver is pretty old. In chapter 10, Jonas said, “I can see that you are very old.” Also, using context clues, most likely on the front cover of the book there is an old man which most likely is the current Giver. Another thing is that the Giver said that long time ago when he was once twelve he felt the same way Jonas did when he came to this training.\nLastly, Jonas is definitely immature than the current Giver who is mature. Jonas was a little frustrated when he learned about the colors and how he wishes he could choose what tunic to wear red or yellow. On the other hand the Giver is patiently and curiously looking at Jonas. The Giver is very mature because, he doesn’t just start shouting out his opinions, or ideas. Probably that’s just because he is older than Jonas. Those are the differences between Jonas and the current Receiver.",
